2,"Marattidae is sister to leptosporangiate ferns in plastid datasets [@nitta2022open], but sometimes resolved as sister to Ophioglossidae in nuclear genomic or transcriptomic datasets [@shen2018largescale; Sessa et al. unpub.]"
3,Some transcriptomic analyses have recovered Hymenophyllaceae sister to Gleicheniaceae [@qi2018wellresolved; @shen2018largescale; Sessa et al. unpub] but it is sister to leptosporangiate ferns excluding Osmundales in plastid datasets [@nitta2022open]
