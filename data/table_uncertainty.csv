1,"Equisetales has been recovered sister to all other ferns in nuclear phylogenomic [@qi2018wellresolved; @shen2018largescale; @sessa2024new], mitochondrial [@cardenas2023third], and plastid analyses with moderate numbers of genes [@testo20164000species; @schneider2004ferns], but sister to Ophioglossales in some plastome phylogenomic analyses [@nitta2022open; @lehtonen2019dynamism] and analysis of plastome structure [@grewe2013complete]."
2,"Marattiales has been recovered sister to leptosporangiate ferns in plastid datasets [@nitta2022open; @testo20164000species; @du2022structural] but sister to Ophioglossales in some nuclear [@shen2018largescale; @sessa2024new] or mitochondrial datasets [@cardenas2023third]."
3,"Hymenophyllaceae has been recovered sister to Gleicheniaceae in nuclear [@qi2018wellresolved; @shen2018largescale; @sessa2024new] or mitochondrial datasets [@cardenas2023third], but sister to leptosporangiate ferns excluding Osmundales in plastid datasets [@nitta2022open; @du2022structural]."
4,"Gleicheniales is monophyletic in plastid analyses with moderate numbers of genes [@testo20164000species] but paraphyletic in most phylogenomic analyses [@nitta2022open; @du2022structural; @pelosi2022phylotranscriptomics; @sessa2024new]."
5,"The family most closely related to eupolypods is Dennstaedtiaceae in most phylogenomic analyses [@nitta2022open; @sessa2024new; @pelosi2022phylotranscriptomics], but Pteridaceae in mitochondrial analysis [@cardenas2023third] and one plastid analysis with a moderate number of genes [@testo20164000species], or Dennstaedtiaceae and Pteridaceae together forming a clade sister to eupolypods has been observed in one whole plastome analysis [@du2022structural]."
