Figure S1: Summary cladogram showing relationships between families of tracheophytes recognized by PPG II, colored by number of taxonomic changes relative to PPG I at the level of genus and higher. Topology for Polypodiopsida modified from Fern Tree of Life (FTOL) v1.7.0 (Nitta & al., 2022). Numbers next to each family indicate number of taxonomic changes, as number of splits (recognition of a new name) / number of sinks (subsumption of one name into another). Color of diamonds indicates number of splits; color of circles indicates number of sinks. Nitta & al. (2022) recovered Salviniales sister to Cyatheales, but this has generally not been observed in other studies (e.g., Schuettpelz & Pryer, 2007; Rothfels & al., 2015; Testo & Sundue, 2016; Du & al., 2022), so the consensus topology is shown instead.
