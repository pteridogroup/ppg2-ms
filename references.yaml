    The sex expression of gametophytes of Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Todaro
    was compared in nature and in culture. Plants raised from multispore
    cultures (100 spores/cm
                  2
                  ) exhibited the most variety in sexual–morphological types. Individually raised plants were slower to develop and showed less variety of sexual types than was found in the multispore cultures. There appeared to be a density effect on development. Field-collected gametophytes showed the least diversity, the populations being largely composed of poorly developed male and neuter plants. The experimental and field data are considered in relation to antheridiogen and population density studies.

    Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongn is a tetraploid fern species that
    contains at least three cryptic species, the south, the north and the third
    type. In this study we combined data from both chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and
    nuclear DNA sequences of three diploid species and three cryptic species of
    C. thalictroides to unravel the origin of the cryptic species, particularly
    of the reticulate relationships among the diploid and tetraploid taxa in the
    genus Ceratopteris. Of the three diploid species examined, C. cornuta had
    cpDNA identical to that of the tetraploid third type plants, and this
    diploid species is a possible maternal ancestor of the tetraploid third
    type. Analysis of the homologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana LEAFY gene
    (CLFY1) identified ten alleles in the genus Ceratopteris, with six alleles
    found in C. thalictroides. The unrooted tree of the CLFY1 gene revealed four
    clusters. Each cryptic species showed fixed heterozygosity at the CLFY1
    locus and had two alleles from different clusters of the CLFY1 tree.
    Consideration of the cpDNA sequences, CLFY1 genotypes of the cryptic species
    and CLFY1 gene tree in concert suggested that the cryptic species of C.
    thalictroides had originated through independent allopolyploidization events
    involving C. cornuta and two unknown hypothetical diploid species.

    rhizome, gold rhizome scales, bipinnate fronds, pilose blade and sori
    present also in apical basiscopic side of the pinnules. The second is also
    similar to the first but with long creeping rhizome, brown and shorter
    rhizome scales, pinnae without an proyected basal acroscopic lobe and more
    light indusium.

                  K). Nutrients were supplied daily with the same volumes for the six different nutrient solutions at exponentially increasing rates corresponding to a maximum relative growth rate (RGR) of 12.5% from days 0 to 31 and 6% from days 32 to 48. RGR was calculated for the highest N and K rate. Photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance to water vapor were determined on day 48, then the plants were harvested. The fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) of different plant components were determined. Shade completely inhibited growth of tubers and fertile shoots and drastically reduced RGR, average aerial shoot height, and DW of shoots and rhizomes. N supplied at the high rate to unshaded plants increased the growth of all parts or the plant except fertile shoots and tubers. No effects of K were detected at the low N rate, whereas at the high N rate, K significantly increased total DW and belowsurface DW. RGR never exceeded 10% d

    Adiantopsis Fe´e (Pteridaceae) is a relatively unstudied tropical
    cheilanthoid fern genus. In the present work, we evaluated the taxonomy and
    relationships among Caribbean Adiantopsis by examining 136 characters from
    approximately 500 herbarium specimens. This study identified nine Caribbean
    Adiantopsis species, three of which are newly described (A. parvisegmenta,
    A. pentagona, and A. vincentii). Additionally, an intriguing pattern of
    morphological and reticulate evolution was revealed by the analyses.
    Adiantopsis consists of three different laminar morphologies; palmate,
    pedate, and pinnate. The two pedate taxa are hypothesized to be fertile
    allotetraploid derivatives of the palmate A. radiata (L.) Fe´e and two
    different pinnate taxa. In this regard they parallel the origin of the South
    American A. 3australopedata Hickey, M. S. Barker & Ponce. Based on our
    analyses, it appears that pedate laminar morphologies in Adiantopsis
    independently originated multiple times via hybridization. This study
    provides testable hypotheses of morphological and reticulate evolution in
    the genus and presents a novel view of Caribbean Adiantopsis.

  abstract: >-
    It has been noted that there is no definite correlation between spore-size
    and the level of polyploidy in the Hamalayan members of Asplenium,
    Cystopteris, Athyrium, and Diplazium. On the basis of average spore-size it
    is practically impossible to surmise the grade of polyploidy of a particular
    species, since several tetraploid species of Asplenium, Diplazium, and
    Athyrium show spores smaller than the diploid ones. However, within a
    'species complex' with differen tcytotypes, the increase in the level of
    poloidy is always associated with a corresponding increase in the size of
    the spore. this may prove useful in plotting out from herbarium material the
    distribution of various cytotypes.

  abstract: >-
    Hybridisation can lead to reproductive isolation and consequently
    speciation. It has been proposed to play an important role in fern
    evolution, but has been difficult to investigate. This study explores the
    utility of target sequence capture and reference guided read phasing to
    investigate the role of evolutionary reticulation in ferns using Australian
    Thelypteridaceae as a model. The bioinformatics workflow HybPhaser was used
    to assess divergence between alleles, phase sequence reads to references to
    construct accessions resembling parental haplotpes, and include them in
    phylogenetic and network analyses to detect hybrids and parentage. This
    approach identified two novel hybrid lineages in Thelypteridaceae, one
    occurring between two different genera ( Abacopteris and Christella ), and
    provided evidence that reticulation is likely to have played an important
    role in the diversification of Australian thelypterids. In addition, hybrid
    phasing successfully reduced conflicting data and improved overall
    resolution in the Thelypteridaceae phylogeny, highlighting the power of this
    approach for reconstructing evolutionary history in reticulated lineages.

    The distribution ofCystopteris fragilis andC. dickieana in Afghanistan
    within the Flora Iranica region is studied. The latter species, for some
    ecological reason, occurs more frequently at higher altitudes. In both taxa
    higher polyploid levels also occur at high altitudes. The phenomenon can be
    correlated with the boreal-arctic distribution pattern. Polyploidism and
    spore-size classes are briefly mentioned as well as possible ecological
    adaptations. Evolutionary differentiation within both taxa are complex and
    still unknown.

    The current understanding of fern phylogeny is primarily based on plastid
    and nuclear sequences, but the third genome—the mitogenome—has remained
    practically unstudied. We inferred the first broad scale fern phylogeny
    based on mitogenomic data, obtained from the One Thousand Plant
    Transcriptomes Initiative project, and compared it with the plastid
    phylogeny. The trees were mostly congruent and corresponded to the current
    understanding of the fern phylogeny, but we observed different evolutionary
    patterns between the two genomes. Protein-coding markers located in the
    plastome had, on average, over two times higher substitution rate than the
    markers from the mitogenome. The similar rate variation pattern between the
    genomes in different fern lineages supports the idea that a common
    mechanism, like life history traits, drives the rates of molecular
    evolution. The few conflicting nodes we observed have also been difficult to
    resolve in other studies, suggesting that even genomic data may not suffice
    to resolve them.

    Reproductive traits of Pteris cadieri and P. grevilleana in Taiwan:
    Implications for their hybrid origin
  type: article-journal
  volume: '51'

- id: chao2012extreme
  abstract: >-
    The Pteris cadieri complex displays extensive morphological variation and
    seems to have originated through hybridization. However, the members of this
    complex reproduce by apogamy, which usually limits genetic variation. To
    evaluate the hypotheses of hybrid origins, the pattern of evolution in this
    species complex is reconstructed. Multiple methodologies were used.
    Diploids, triploids, and tetraploids were identified by chromosome counts
    and flow cytometry. Nuclear DNA markers (cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase
    gene, PgiC) were used, together with chloroplast DNA markers (atpB-rbcL
    spacer and rbcL gene) to infer the biparental and maternal lineages of the
    Pteris cadieri complex. The three cpDNA haplotype groups and five PgiC
    alleles found in this study indicate that the evolution of the Pteris
    cadieri complex has been extremely reticulate. Up to 11 taxa belonging to
    eight morphs were identified. By comparing genetic variation in the Pteris
    cadieri in two independent areas, Hainan and Taiwan, we inferred that
    hybridization has occurred independently in different areas. Furthermore, we
    found evidence for phenological divergence (evergreen and deciduous) within
    Taiwan. We propose that the Pteris cadieri complex originated from different
    genetic lineages through multiple hybridizations in different geographical
    areas, leading to its present morphological diversity.

    The Pteris cadieri complex is widely distributed in South and East Asia. Due
    to tremendous morphological variation within and between taxa, previous
    taxonomic treatments have been plagued with an element of uncertainty. In
    this study, the morphological characteristics, along with data from previous
    studies on reproductive modes, cytology, and genotypes, are integrated to
    clarify and delineate each taxon. Nine taxa are recognized in the Pteris
    cadieri complex: three original species (P. cadieri, P. hainanensis and P.
    grevilleana), one reinstated name (P. dimorpha, synonymized under P.
    cadieri), two new species (P. incurvata sp. nov. and P. perplexa sp. nov.),
    two new varieties (P. dimorpha var. prolongata var. nov., and P. dimorpha
    var. metagrevilleana var. nov.), and a forma (P. grevilleana f. ornata stat.
    nov.). The lectotypes of P. cadieri, P. dimorpha, P. grevilleana, and P.
    hainanensis are designated. Each taxon is described in detail. A key is
    provided to facilitate the identification of all taxa.

  abstract: >-
    Davallia repens and its close relatives have been identified as a species
    complex in this study because of the existence of continuously morphological
    variation. To decipher its evolutionary history, integrated methodologies
    were applied in this study including morphology, cytology, reproductive
    biology and molecular phylogeny. Analysis of morphological characters
    reveals several important discriminating characteristics, such as the shape
    of stipe scales, frond and indusium. Both diploid and polyploid forms are
    present in the complex and reproduce sexually and by apogamy, respectively.
    The incongruence between cpDNA and nDNA phylogeny indicates a hybrid origin
    for most polyploid individuals. Based on the present results, we hypothesize
    that there were at least two ancestral lineages distributed in the Malesian
    region. Through hybridization, polyploidization and apogamy, some polyploid
    genotypes dispersed outwards to shape the extant distribution.

    © 2017, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan KK. The
    phylogenetic affinities of the fern genus Aenigmopteris have been the
    subject of considerable disagreement, but until now, no molecular data were
    available from the genus. Based on the analysis of three chloroplast DNA
    regions (rbcL, rps16-matK, and trnL-F) we demonstrate that Aenigmopteris
    dubia (the type species of the genus) and A. elegans are closely related and
    deeply imbedded in Tectaria. The other three species of genus are
    morphologically very similar; we therefore transfer all five known species
    into Tectaria. Detailed morphological comparison further shows that
    previously proposed diagnostic characters of Aenigmopteris fall within the
    range of variation of a broadly circumscribed Tectaria.

  abstract: >-
    The transition from aquatic to terrestrial eggs is a key evolutionary change
    that has allowed vertebrates to successfully colonize and exploit the land.
    Although most amphibians retain the primitive biphasic life cycle (eggs
    deposited in water that hatch into free-living aquatic larvae), direct
    development of terrestrial eggs has evolved repeatedly and may have been
    critical to the evolutionary success of several amphibian groups. We provide
    the ﬁrst conclusive evidence for evolutionary reversal of direct development
    in vertebrates. The family Plethodontidae (lungless salamanders) contains
    the majority of salamander species, including major radiations of direct
    developers. We reconstruct the higher level phylogenetic relationships of
    plethodontid salamanders using molecular and morphological data and use this
    phylogeny to examine the evolution of direct development. We show that the
    predominantly biphasic desmognathines, previously considered the sister
    group of other plethodontids, are nested inside a group of directdeveloping
    species (Plethodontini) and have re-evolved the aquatic larval stage. Rather
    than being an evolutionary dead end, the reversal from direct developing to
    biphasic life history may have helped communities in eastern North America
    to achieve the highest local diversity of salamander species in the world.

  abstract: >-
    The phylogenetic position of Dracoglossum Christenh. is studied here for the
    first time using DNA sequence data. Based on a broad sampling of eupolypod
    ferns and four plastid genes (atpA, atpB, rbcL, rps4), we show that
    Dracoglossum does not belong to the genus Tectaria Cav., in which it was
    previously placed, nor is it closely related to that genus or any other
    member of Tectariaceae. Our results provide strong support to suggest that
    Dracoglossum forms a rather isolated lineage, which is sister to Lomariopsis
    Fe´e, and that the genus should therefore be placed in Lomariopsidaceae.

    Background and Aims Throughout the history of fern classification, familial
    and generic concepts have been highly labile. Many classifications and
    evolutionary schemes have been proposed during the last two centuries,
    reflecting different interpretations of the available evidence. Knowledge of
    fern structure and life histories has increased through time, providing more
    evidence on which to base ideas of possible relationships, and
    classification has changed accordingly. This paper reviews previous
    classifications of ferns and presents ideas on how to achieve a more stable
    consensus. Scope An historical overview is provided from the first to the
    most recent fern classifications, from which conclusions are drawn on past
    changes and future trends. The problematic concept of family in ferns is
    discussed, with a particular focus on how this has changed over time. The
    history of molecular studies and the most recent findings are also
    presented. Key Results Fern classification generally shows a trend from
    highly artificial, based on an interpretation of a few extrinsic characters,
    via natural classifications derived from a multitude of intrinsic
    characters, towards more evolutionary circumscriptions of groups that do not
    in general align well with the distribution of these previously used
    characters. It also shows a progression from a few broad family concepts to
    systems that recognized many more narrowly and highly controversially
    circumscribed families; currently, the number of families recognized is
    stabilizing somewhere between these extremes. Placement of many genera was
    uncertain until the arrival of molecular phylogenetics, which has rapidly
    been improving our understanding of fern relationships. As a collective
    category, the so-called 'fern allies' (e.g. Lycopodiales, Psilotaceae,
    Equisetaceae) were unsurprisingly found to be polyphyletic, and the term
    should be abandoned. Lycopodiaceae, Selaginellaceae and Isoëtaceae form a
    clade (the lycopods) that is sister to all other vascular plants, whereas
    the whisk ferns (Psilotaceae), often included in the lycopods or believed to
    be associated with the first vascular plants, are sister to Ophioglossaceae
    and thus belong to the fern clade. The horsetails (Equisetaceae) are also
    members of the fern clade (sometimes inappropriately called 'monilophytes'),
    but, within that clade, their placement is still uncertain. Leptosporangiate
    ferns are better understood, although deep relationships within this group
    are still unresolved. Earlier, almost all leptosporangiate ferns were placed
    in a single family (Polypodiaceae or Dennstaedtiaceae), but these families
    have been redefined to narrower more natural entities. Conclusions
    Concluding this paper, a classification is presented based on our current
    understanding of relationships of fern and lycopod clades. Major changes in
    our understanding of these families are highlighted, illustrating issues of
    classification in relation to convergent evolution and false homologies.
    Problems with the current classification and groups that still need study
    are pointed out. A summary phylogenetic tree is also presented. A new
    classification in which Aspleniaceae, Cyatheaceae, Polypodiaceae and
    Schizaeaceae are expanded in comparison with the most recent classifications
    is presented, which is a modification of those proposed by Smith et al.
    (2006, 2008) and Christenhusz et al. (2011). These classifications are now
    finding a wider acceptance and use, and even though a few amendments are
    made based on recently published results from molecular analyses, we have
    aimed for a stable family and generic classification of ferns.

  abstract: >-
    Here we focus on the “skinneri clade” of cheilanthoid ferns (Pteridaceae),
    revising its taxonomy based on a new set of molecular, cytogenetic, and
    morphological analyses. Though previously assigned to disparate genera, the
    five taxa formally recognized in this clade form a strongly supported
    monophyletic group when analyzed with both plastid (rbcL, atpA, trnG-R) and
    nuclear (gapCp) datasets. This novel lineage is recognized here as Ynesmexia
    gen. nov. in honor of Ynés Mexía, a pioneering Mexican-American botanist.
    Our molecular analyses indicate that Ynesmexia comprises two monophyletic
    groups, referred to here as the “subcordata” and “seemannii” subclades. The
    “subcordata” subclade encompasses plants previously treated as Cheilanthes
    skinneri, ×Hemionanthes gryphus and Hemionitis subcordata. Our data indicate
    that the first taxon comprises two species: a diploid treated here as
    Ynesmexia fournieri (comb. nov.) and a tetraploid corresponding to Y.
    skinneri (comb. nov.) s.str. Amplifying the differences in ploidy, these two
    taxa are distinguished by several aspects of sporophyte morphology,
    non-overlapping spore sizes, and allopatric geographic distributions. Our
    analyses also highlight the role of hybridization and polyploidy in the
    evolution of the group, indicating that: (1) Y. ×gryphus (comb. nov.) is a
    largely fertile homoploid hybrid between Y. subcordata (comb. nov.) and Y.
    fournieri, and (2) Y. skinneri s.str. is an allotetraploid between members
    of the “subcordata” and “seemannii” subclades. Although the latter subclade
    is morphologically (and likely cytogenetically) diverse, current data are
    insufficient to propose formal subdivision of the only recognized species,
    Y. seemannii (comb. nov.). The findings presented here challenge earlier
    taxonomic frameworks and offer new insights into the evolutionary history of
    this xeric-adapted fern lineage, underscoring the importance of using
    multi-faceted approaches to resolve complex taxonomic issues in plant
    biology.

    While the family Schizaeaceae (Schizaeales) represents only about 0.4% of
    the extant fern species diversity, it differs from other ferns greatly in
    gross morphologies, niche preferences, and life histories. One of the most
    notable features in this family is its mycoheterotrophic life style in the
    gametophytic stage, which appears to be associated with extensive losses of
    plastid genes. However, the limited number of sequenced plastomes, and the
    lack of a wellresolved phylogenetic framework of Schizaeaceae, makes it
    difficult to gain any further insight. Here, with a comprehensive sampling
    of ~77% of the species diversity of this family, we first inferred a plastid
    phylogeny of Schizaeaceae using three DNA regions. To resolve the deep
    relationships within this family, we then reconstructed a plastome-based
    phylogeny focusing on a selection of representatives that covered all the
    major clades. From this phylogenomic backbone, we traced the evolutionary
    histories of plastid genes and examined whether gene losses were associated
    with the evolution of gametophytic mycoheterotrophy. Our results reveal that
    extant Schizaeaceae is comprised of four major clades—Microschizaea,
    Actinostachys, Schizaea, and Schizaea pusilla. The loss of all plastid
    NADH-like dehydrogenase (ndh) genes was confirmed to have occurred in the
    ancestor of extant Schizaeaceae, which coincides with the evolution of
    mycoheterotrophy in this family. For chlorophyll biosynthesis genes (chl),
    the losses were interpreted as convergent in Schizaeaceae, and found not
    only in Actinostachys, a clade producing achlorophyllous gametophytes, but
    also in S. pusilla with chlorophyllous gametophytes. In addition, we
    discovered a previously undescribed but phylogenetically distinct species
    hidden in the Schizaea dichotoma complex and provided a taxonomic treatment
    and morphological diagnostics for this new species—Schizaea medusa. Finally,
    our phylogenetic results suggest that the current PPG I circumscription of
    Schizaea is non-monophyletic, and we therefore proposed a three-genus
    classification moving a subset of Schizaea species sensu PPG I to a third
    genus—Microschizaea.

    The origin and early evolution of land plants in the mid-Palaeozoic era,
    between about 480 and 360 million years ago, wasan important event in the
    history of life, with far-reaching consequences for the evolution of
    terrestrial organisms and global environments. A recent surge of interest,
    catalysed by palaeobotanical discoveries and advances in the systematics of
    living plants, provides a revised perspective on the evolution of early land
    plants and suggests new directions for future research.

    Here we describe 18 new species of the Marattialean genus Danaea: D. alba,
    D. ampla, D. antioquiana, D. elongata, D. kessleri and D. panamensis (all in
    D. subg. Danaea); D. dilatata and D. opaca (in D. subg. Arthrodanaea); and
    D. andina, D. cuspidopsis, D. erosa, D. nasua, D. peruviana, D. polypinna,
    D. pumila, D. robbinmoranii, D. ubatubensis, and D. velona (in D. subg.
    Holodanaea). We provide illustrations, maps of geographical distribution,
    and nomenclatural notes for the new species. We also lectotypify the name D.
    media and propose that its recent resurrection was a mistake: both D. media
    and D. elata are synonyms of D. nodosa, which is widespread in Central
    America and the Greater Antilles; we find that D. pterorachis is a valid
    name applicable to the Costa Rican material that has been referred to D.
    media. We consider D. sellowiana and D. nigrescens as distinct species and
    these names applicable to D. subg. Danaea material from the Brazilian
    Atlantic Forest and Amazonia, respectively, and we also lectotypify the name
    D. nigrescens here. We accept D. cuspidata and D. betancurii as species
    distinct from D. moritziana. Evolutionary relationships and an
    identification key for the 79 species we currently recognize in Danaea are
    published in a parallel paper (Keskiniva & al. 2024).

  abstract: >-
    We have produced a near-complete phylogeny for the neotropical fern genus
    Danaea (Marattiaceae). The phylogeny is based on four loci of the
    chloroplast DNA and shows reconstructions of the evolutionary relationships
    between 68 of the currently recognized 81 taxa of Danaea. A parallel paper
    (Keskiniva & Tuomisto 2024) draws on this phylogeny to describe 18 new
    species; here we discuss the phylogeny and its taxonomical implications more
    broadly. We propose three new synonyms: D. atlantica Christenh. & al. (= D.
    geniculata), D. draco Christenh. (= D. polymorpha), and D. moralesiana A.
    Rojas (= D. erecta). On the other hand, we consider D. jamaicensis Underw.,
    which has been synonymized before, to be a distinct species. In addition, we
    propose that D. ×ushana is a hybrid between D. simplicifolia and D.
    nigrescens. We also provide an open-access online key to the 81 taxa. The
    key is available at
    https://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v4/neo_fern_genus_danaea/.

    The number of hybrids has been reported to be lower in tropical than
    temperate ferns, but patterns of hybridization are poorly known in the
    tropics. We examine hybridization in the Neotropical fern genus Danaea
    (Marattiaceae) using a phylogenomic approach with single or low-copy nuclear
    and chloroplast loci and haplotype phasing. We find a high hybridization
    rate of 10%–18% for Danaea, similar to the rates observed for temperate
    ferns. We find further evidence for the previously proposed low reproductive
    barriers in ferns, enabling hybridization and even the production of
    hybridization-derived species between lineages separated possibly as far
    back as the Cretaceous. We found that Danaea trifoliata and D. wendlandii
    are fertile, hybridization-derived species between lineages diverged
    potentially 14–72 million years ago (mya) and 23–62 mya, respectively. We
    also confirm that the previously recognized species D. ×ushana is a likely
    sterile hybrid between D. simplicifolia (D. subg. Arthrodanaea) and D.
    nigrescens (D. subg. Danaea), which diverged potentially 27–83 mya. We find
    that hybridization may function as a homogenizing force in Danaea, as the
    subgenus with the highest signals for hybridization (D. subg. Arthrodanaea)
    also has the fewest species that are the least morphologically and
    genetically diverged. We describe a new hybrid between D. wendlandii (D.
    subg. Holodanaea) and D. subg. Danaea as D. ×deltoidea.

    Ferns and lycophytes of Taiwan display an extraordinarily high diversity.
    Despite the detailed species documentation, the pteridophyte flora of Taiwan
    as a whole has never been organized into a phylogenetic framework. Here we
    provide an updated, phylogeny-based checklist that includes a total of 824
    (infra)species taxa, of which eleven are first recorded. In addition,
    lectotypification of Phlegmariurus salvinioides and new combinations of 25
    taxa were made in this study. Our classification scheme is based on the most
    recent phylogenetic evidence, and for all taxon names accepted here, we
    provide their best corresponding names in Taiwanese Mandarin. Our appendix
    and the online file also supply other details, such as synonyms, for the
    Taiwanese pteridophytes in order to track their nomenclatural changes from
    the previous floristic documentations. Finally, a discussion group for our
    community-Taiwan Pteridophyte Group (TPG)- is established online. This
    platform will allow more users to follow further updates of TPG or to
    provide any comments on new versions of Taiwan pteridophyte checklist.

    In Indochina the species diversity of Cyatheaceae remains insufficiently
    known. Here we demonstrate the scaly tree fern Gymnosphaera salletii in
    Vietnam to be an assemblage of three distinct species based on molecular and
    morphological data, and report for the first time the occurrence of foliar
    nectaries in Gymnosphaera. The true G. salletii is morphologically unique
    based on the protuberant glands present on the petiole. Gymnosphaera
    phankelocii sp. nov. and Gymnosphaera vietnamensis sp. nov. are recognized
    as new species; G. phankelocii is characterized by its distant two-rowed
    sori and G. vietnamensis by the sub-tripinnate fronds. Our phylogenetic
    analyses indicated that G. phankelocii is a relatively isolated species,
    while G. vietnamensis is a member of the G. salletii clade along with G.
    austroyunnanensis, G. salletii, and G. saxicola. The two new species and
    members of the G. salletii clade are all local endemics, and provide good
    examples to understand the frequent local endemics and their evolution in
    scaly tree ferns. Eleven species of Gymnosphaera are now known from
    Indochina; we provide a diagnostic key to these species.

    The large size and complexity of most fern genomes have hampered efforts to
    elucidate fundamental aspects of fern biology and land plant evolution
    through genome-enabled research. Here we present a chromosomal genome
    assembly and associated methylome, transcriptome and metabolome analyses for
    the model fern species Ceratopteris richardii . The assembly reveals a
    history of remarkably dynamic genome evolution including rapid changes in
    genome content and structure following the most recent whole-genome
    duplication approximately 60 million years ago. These changes include
    massive gene loss, rampant tandem duplications and multiple horizontal gene
    transfers from bacteria, contributing to the diversification of
    defence-related gene families. The insertion of transposable elements into
    introns has led to the large size of the Ceratopteris genome and to
    exceptionally long genes relative to other plants. Gene family analyses
    indicate that genes directing seed development were co-opted from those
    controlling the development of fern sporangia, providing insights into seed
    plant evolution. Our findings and annotated genome assembly extend the
    utility of Ceratopteris as a model for investigating and teaching plant
    biology.

  abstract: >-
    Like many fern lineages comprising reticulate species complexes, Polypodium
    s.s. (Polypodiacaeae) has a history shaped by rapid diversiﬁcation,
    hybridization, and polyploidy that poses substantial challenges for
    phylogenetic inference with plastid and single-locus nuclear markers. Using
    target capture probes for 408 nuclear loci developed by the GoFlag project
    and a custom bioinformatic pipeline, SORTER, we constructed multi-locus
    nuclear datasets for diploid temperate and Mesoamerican species of
    Polypodium and ﬁve allotetraploid species belonging to the well-studied
    Polypodium vulgare complex. SORTER employs a clustering approach to separate
    putatively paralogous copies of targeted loci into orthologous matrices and
    haplotype phasing to infer allopolyploid haplotypes across loci, resulting
    in datasets amenable to both concatenated maximum likelihood and
    multi-species coalescent phylogenetic analyses. By comparing phylogenies
    derived from maximum likelihood and multi-species coalescent analyses of
    unphased and phased datasets, as well as evaluating discordance among gene
    trees and species trees, we recover support for incomplete lineage sorting
    within Polypodium s.s., novel relationships among diploid taxa of the
    Polypodium vulgare complex and its Mesoamerican sister clade, and the
    placement of several Polypodium species within other genera. Additionally,
    we were able to infer well-supported phylogenies that identiﬁed the
    hypothesized progenitors of the allotetraploid species, indicating that
    SORTER is an effective and accurate tool for reconstructing homeolog
    haplotypes of allopolyploids in fern taxa and other nonmodel organisms from
    target capture data.

    Methods: We employed a large target‐capture data set to investigate the
    evolution of genetic, morphological, and ecological variation in P.
    pellucidum. With a broad sampling across ﬁve Hawaiian Islands, we deciphered
    the evolutionary history of P. pellucidum, identiﬁed nonhybrid lineages and
    intraspeciﬁc hybrids, and inferred the relative inﬂuence of geography and
    ecology on their distributions.

    Results: Polypodium pellucidum is monophyletic, dispersing to the Hawaiian
    archipelago 11.53–7.77 Ma and diversifying into extant clades between 5.66
    and 4.73 Ma. We identiﬁed four nonhybrid clades with unique morphologies,
    ecological niches, and distributions. Additionally, we elucidated several
    intraspeciﬁc hybrid combinations and evidence for undiscovered or extinct
    “ghost” lineages contributing to extant hybrid populations.

    Conclusions: We provide a foundation for revising the taxonomy of P.
    pellucidum to account for cryptic lineages and intraspeciﬁc hybrids.
    Geologic succession of the Hawaiian Islands through cycles of volcanism,
    vegetative succession, and erosion has determined the available habitats and
    distribution of ecologically speciﬁc, divergent clades within P. pellucidum.
    Intraspeciﬁc hybrids have likely arisen due to ecological and or geological
    transitions, often persisting after the local extinction of their
    progenitors. This research contributes to our understanding of the evolution
    of Hawai'i's diverse fern ﬂora and illuminated cryptic taxa to allow
    better‐informed conservation eﬀorts.

    Ferns, with about 12,000 species, are the second most diverse lineage of
    vascular plants after angiosperms. They have been the subject of numerous
    molecular phylogenetic studies, resulting in the publication of trees for
    every major clade and DNA sequences from nearly half of all species. Global
    fern phylogenies have been published periodically, but as molecular
    systematics research continues at a rapid pace, these become quickly
    outdated. Here, we develop a mostly automated, reproducible, open pipeline
    to generate a continuously updated fern tree of life (FTOL) from DNA
    sequence data available in GenBank. Our tailored sampling strategy combines
    whole plastomes (few taxa, many loci) with commonly sequenced plastid
    regions (many taxa, few loci) to obtain a global, species-level fern
    phylogeny with high resolution along the backbone and maximal sampling
    across the tips. We use a curated reference taxonomy to resolve synonyms in
    general compliance with the community-driven Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group I
    classification. The current FTOL includes 5,582 species, an increase of
                  ca.
                  40% relative to the most recently published global fern phylogeny. Using an updated and expanded list of 51 fern fossil constraints, we find estimated ages for most families and deeper clades to be considerably older than earlier studies. FTOL and its accompanying datasets, including the fossil list and taxonomic database, will be updated on a regular basis and are available via a web portal (
                  https://fernphy.github.io
                  ) and R packages, enabling immediate access to the most up-to-date, comprehensively sampled fern phylogeny. FTOL will be useful for anyone studying this important group of plants over a wide range of taxonomic scales, from smaller clades to the entire tree. We anticipate FTOL will be particularly relevant for macroecological studies at regional to global scales and will inform future taxonomic systems with the most recent hypothesis of fern phylogeny.

    Ferns are the second largest clade of vascular plants with over 10,000
    species, yet the generation of genomic resources for the group has lagged
    behind other major clades of plants. Transcriptomic data have proven to be a
    powerful tool to assess phylogenetic relationships, using thousands of
    markers that are largely conserved across the genome, and without the need
    to sequence entire genomes. We assembled the largest nuclear phylogenetic
    dataset for ferns to date, including 2884 single-copy nuclear loci from 247
    transcriptomes (242 ferns, ﬁve outgroups), and investigated phylogenetic
    relationships across the fern tree, the placement of whole genome
    duplications (WGDs), and gene retention patterns following WGDs. We
    generated a well-supported phylogeny of ferns and identiﬁed several regions
    of the fern phylogeny that demonstrate high levels of gene tree–species tree
    conﬂict, which largely correspond to areas of the phylogeny that have been
    difﬁcult to resolve. Using a combination of approaches, we identiﬁed 27 WGDs
    across the phylogeny, including 18 largescale events (involving more than
    one sampled taxon) and nine small-scale events (involving only one sampled
    taxon). Most inferred WGDs occur within single lineages (e.g., orders,
    families) rather than on the backbone of the phylogeny, although two
    inferred events are shared by leptosporangiate ferns (excluding Osmundales)
    and Polypodiales (excluding Lindsaeineae and Saccolomatineae), clades which
    correspond to the majority of fern diversity. We further examined how
    retained duplicates following WGDs compared across independent events and
    found that functions of retained genes were largely convergent, with
    processes involved in binding, responses to stimuli, and certain organelles
    over-represented in paralogs while processes involved in transport,
    organelles derived from endosymbiotic events, and signaling were
    under-represented. To date, our study is the most comprehensive
    investigation of the nuclear fern phylogeny, though several avenues for
    future research remain unexplored.

    The fern genus
                  Microsorum
                  is not monophyletic, with previous phylogenetic analyses finding three lineages to group not with the type species, but to form a grade related to the 13 species of
                  Lecanopteris
                  . These three lineages have recently been recognised as separate
     genera:
                  Bosmania
                  ,
                  Dendroconche
                  , and
                  Zealandia
                  . Here, we explore the morphological characterisation of
                  Lecanopteris
                  and these other three lecanopteroid genera. While the\ traditional circumscription of
                  Lecanopteris
                  has seemed sacrosanct, its defining morphological
     character states of rhizome cavities and ant brooding associations occur in other lecanopteroid ferns and elsewhere in the
                  Polypodiaceae
                  . Instead, we suggest that the morphological characterisation of an expanded
                  Lecanopteris
                  including the
                  Dendroconche
                  and
                  Zealandia
                  lineages is just as good, if not better, with the pertinent character states being the absence of sclerenchyma strands in the rhizome and atleast some fronds having Nooteboom's type 5 venation pattern. This wider circumscription is also better able to accommodate phylogenetic uncertainty,
     and it means that groups of species traditionally placed together in a single genus are not distributed across different genera. General users familiar with the narrower circumscription of
                  Lecanopteris
                  will not be significantly disrupted, because there is little geographic overlap with
     the lineages added to the genus. Consequently, we make new combinations in
                  Lecanopteris
                  for 11 species and one subspecies.

    Woodsiaceae is a monophyletic fern family comprising around 65 taxa that
    inhabit mainly mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere but also with
    numerous species in southern America and Africa. Recent molecular studies
    recognize two genera in the family: Woodsia, restricted to the northern
    hemisphere, and Physematium, present in Central and South America, Africa
    and East Asia. Traditionally, in South America the family has been
    considered to include a single species, Woodsia montevidensis, very variable
    morphologically, a treatment that underestimates the diversity of South
    American taxa. Therefore, we carried out a taxonomic review that included
    comparative analyses of morphological and palynological characters as well
    as distributional data. In the Southern Cone, Physematium is characterized
    by sori with saucer- or bowl-shaped lower indusia, splitting into 1–3 lobes
    in the mature sori. The taxa inhabit mountainous regions, between 200 m to
    more than 4000 m in altitude. Four species are recognized in the genus
    Physematium in the Southern Cone: one new species, P. hieronymi, and three
    that were previously treated as synonyms of P. montevidense, publishing here
    the corresponding new combinations. A key, descriptions, illustrations and
    distribution maps of the species are provided.

  abstract: >-
    Ferns account for 80% of nonflowering vascular plant species and are the
    sister lineage of seed plants. Recent molecular phylogenetics have greatly
    advanced understanding of fern tree of life, but relationships among some
    major lineages remain unclear. To better resolve the phylogenetic
    relationships of ferns, we generated transcriptomes from 125 ferns and two
    lycophytes, with three additional public datasets, to represent all 11
    orders and 85% of families of ferns. Our nuclear phylogeny provides strong
    supports for the monophyly of all four subclasses and nearly all orders and
    families, and for relationships among these lineages. The only exception is
    Gleicheniales, which was highly supported as being paraphyletic with
    Dipteridaceae sister to a clade with Gleicheniaceae + Hymenophyllales. In
    addition, new and strongly supported phylogenetic relationships are found
    for suborders and families in Polypodiales. We provide the first dated fern
    phylogenomic tree using many nuclear genes from a large majority of
    families, with an estimate for separation of the ancestors of ferns and seed
    plants in early Devonian at ∼400 Mya and subsequent gradual divergences of
    fern orders from ∼380 to 200 Mya. Moreover, the newly obtained fern
    phylogeny provides a framework for gene family analyses, which indicate that
    the vast majority of transcription factor families found in seed plants were
    already present in the common ancestor of extant vascular plants. In
    addition, fern transcription factor genes show similar duplication patterns
    to those in seed plants, with some showing stable copy number and others
    displaying independent expansions in both ferns and seed plants. This study
    provides a robust phylogenetic and gene family evolution framework, as well
    as rich molecular resources for understanding the morphological and
    functional evolution in ferns.

    The roughly 500 species of cheilanthoid ferns exhibit a diversity of
    morphological adaptations to xeric environments. However, most of these
    traits have evolved independently multiple times, impeding past efforts to
    establish a natural classification for the group. Considerable progress has
    been made over the past three decades resolving most of the major lineages,
    with the notable exception of the hemionitids, the largest and most widely
    distributed clade. The nearly 350 hemionitid species can be found in dry
    regions across the globe and account for two-thirds of cheilanthoid
    diversity. While some of the 17 genera commonly attributed to this group are
    easily recognized and demonstrably monophyletic, others have been shown to
    be clearly non-monophyletic. Here, we explore phylogenetic relationships
    among hemionitid species using a dataset that greatly expands on earlier
    studies. We carefully consider generic lines and propose a phylogenetically
    informed classification that better aligns with morphology, geography, and
    evolutionary history. Based on our analyses and morphological
    investigations, we propose the recognition of 22 monophyletic hemionitid
    genera. Nine of our generic circumscriptions are consistent with those of
    most other recent studies. Two other genera are expanded relative to these
    studies, while two are more narrowly defined. Two generic names are
    resurrected herein and seven genera are newly described to accommodate
    divergent clades. In all, 106 new species-level (plus 9 subspecific)
    combinations are made.

    New Zealand is home to 16 endemic species of Lepidium (Brassicaceae),
    including two species considered to have become extinct since European
    colonisation and an additional species shared with Australia. Previous
    meiotic chromosome counts suggest at least some are high polyploids. A
    hybrid origin has been proposed for several of them, with African and
    American species implicated as parents. We generated amplicon sequence data
    for 15 genes derived from targeted enrichment data from a selection of
    species endemic to New Zealand, and of African, American, and Australian
    origin naturalised in New Zealand. These were analysed, along with publicly
    available genomic data from other Lepidium species. Our results are
    consistent with earlier work in supporting two main groups of endemic New
    Zealand Lepidium, corresponding to different dominant nrDNA sequences. Our
    data suggest that these two groups differ in ploidy (one octoploid, the
    ploidy of the other uncertain). The octoploid species combine four
    distinguishable subgenomes and the other species may be the products of
    allopolyploidisation between octoploid species and a diploid species closely
    related to, if not, L. africanum. Previously proposed links to American
    Lepidium are also supported, with at least two Australasian Lepidium
    subgenomes related to subgenomes present in American polyploid species. The
    affinities of two further subgenomes present in Australasian Lepidium remain
    to be determined, but they may also be of American origin. One New Zealand
    endemic species, L. naufragorum, displays sequences broadly consistent with
    it being the octodecaploid product of hybridisation between octoploid and
    decaploid New Zealand groups.

    Relationships among the major subclades in the fern family Pteridaceae have
    proven difﬁcult to resolve. Here, we examine the backbone of this large and
    heterogeneous lineage using both phylotranscriptomic methods and a more
    focused, curated approach. We ﬁnd that Pteridoideae and Parkerioideae are
    together sister to the rest of Pteridaceae and that Cryptogrammoideae is
    sister to Vittarioideae plus Cheilanthoideae. We ﬁnd independent support
    from our phylotranscriptomic analyses, published cytological data, and
    genomic distributions of substitutions per site for several whole-genome
    duplication (WGD) events within Pteridaceae, mainly in Vittarioideae and
    Cheilanthoideae. However, the various inference methods gave differing
    approximations for the placement of WGD events within each clade. This study
    demonstrates that phylotranscriptomic analyses, which employ large datasets
    at the cost of requiring simpler models and potentially a greater risk of
    systematic error, can be used in concert with more curated approaches to
    resolve deep phylogenetic relationships. It also provides an example of the
    difﬁculty of conﬁdently inferring ancient WGD event placement, even when
    using multiple methods.

    Phylogenetic and morphological analyses support the resurrection of

    subfamily Microsoroideae
  type: article-journal
  volume: '44'

  abstract: >-
    We undertook a molecular phylogenetic revision of hayscented ferns
    (Dennstaedtiaceae: Dennstaedtioideae) using four plastid markers. Our
    sampling represents ca. 40% of the extant diversity and includes the type
    species for each of the relevant segregate genera. We coded 18 discrete
    morphological characters which we used to find diagnosable clades. We show
    that Dennstaedtia is polyphyletic, with the majority of species forming
    three morphologically distinct clades, but its type (D. flaccida) is nested
    within Microlepia. As such, we support the conservation of Dennstaedtia with
    a new type, D. dissecta. Following our results, we develop a classification
    of four genera: Dennstaedtia, Microlepia, Mucura (gen. nov.) and Sitobolium.
    Beyond the inclusion of D. flaccida, we propose to maintain Microlepia with
    its current circumscription. Except for a single adventive species in the
    Neotropics, Microlepia is a Paleotropical genus of about 60 species
    diagnosed by their distinctive perispore ornamentation of rodlets, and by
    petioles that lack epipetiolar buds. Mucura is a Neotropical genus of two
    species that differ from all other Dennstaedtiaceae by the combination of
    dichotomously branching rhizomes, petioles that lack epipetiolar buds,
    marginal sori with both abaxial and adaxial indusia, and trilete spores with
    a unique perispore ornamentation. As defined here, Dennstaedtia is a
    pantropical genus of about 55 species recognized by having unbranched
    rhizomes, petioles bearing epipetiolar buds, and by often bearing
    proliferous buds upon the leaves. Sitobolium is a small clade of ca. five
    species distinguished by their relatively small leaves that have elongate
    catenate hairs. These hairs often bear a capitate non-glandular terminal
    cell. In support of our classification, we provide a key to the eleven
    genera of Dennstaedtiaceae, and for the four genera of Dennstaedtioideae we
    provide morphological and geographic synopses, a list of constituent
    species, and necessary new combinations.

    Methods: By phasing captured reads within a phylogenomic data set of GoFlag
    408 nuclear loci using HybPhaser, we investigated candidate hybrids to
    identify parental lineages. We estimated divergence ages by inferring a
    dated phylogeny using fossil calibrations with treePL. We investigated
    ecological niche conservatism between one conﬁrmed intergeneric
    allotetraploid and its diploid progenitors using the centroid, overlap,
    unﬁlling, and expansion (COUE) framework.

    Results: We provide evidence for at least six instances of intergeneric
    hybrid speciation within the christelloid clade and estimate up to 45
    million years of divergence between progenitors. The niche quantiﬁcation
    analysis showed moderate niche overlap between an allopolyploid species and
    its progenitors, with signiﬁcant divergence from the niche of one progenitor
    and conservatism to the other.

    Conclusions: The examples provided here highlight the overlooked role that
    allopolyploidization following intergeneric hybridization may play in fern
    diversiﬁcation and range and niche expansions. Applying this approach to
    other fern taxa may reveal a similar pattern of deep hybridization resulting
    in highly successful novel lineages.

    Abstract
                
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. comprises ca. 60 species with a disjunct Africa/Asia and Australia distribution. The infrageneric classification of
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. is controversial based on the phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast markers and morphology. Based on the expanded taxon sampling of
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. (51 species), we investigated its phylogeny, biogeography, character evolution and environmental adaptation by employing five chloroplastid markers (
                  rbc

                  S) and one single (low)-copy nuclear gene,
                  LEAFY
                  .
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. was divided into six major clades and eight subclades. Reticulate evolution was revealed both among clades and among species in
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. Ancestral character state optimization revealed high levels of homoplastic evolution of the diagnostic characters in
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l., while the crassulacean acid metabolism pathway seems to have an independent origin. Molecular dating and biogeographic diversification analyses suggested that
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. originated no later than the Oligocene and the main clades diversified during the Oligocene and Miocene, with southern Asia, the Indo-China Peninsula and southwestern and southern China as the most likely ancestral areas. Transoceanic long-distance dispersal, rather than vicariance, contributed to the intercontinental disjunction. Diversification scenarios of
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. under geological movements and climate fluctuation are also discussed.

    A revised subfamilial classification of Polypodiaceae based on plastome,
    nuclear ribosomal, and morphological evidence
  type: article-journal

- id: xu2025phylogeny
  abstract: >-
    Although considerable progress has recently been made in the phylogeny of
    Hymenasplenium, the genus remains poorly investigated; speciﬁcally, the
    diversiﬁcation and historical biogeography of the genus have been little
    studied. Here, we infer an updated plastid DNA phylogeny and the ﬁrst
    large‐scale nuclear DNA phylogeny to understand the biogeography of the
    genus. The plastid phylogeny includes 312 accessions from across the genus′
    distribution range (ca. 121% increase of the latest sampling), with special
    attention paid to island accessions from 14 Indian Ocean and Paciﬁc islands,
    whereas the nuclear phylogeny includes 161 accessions of the Afro–Eurasian
    species. We identify one new major clade and two new subclades. Reticulate
    evolution was revealed both among subclades and among species in the
    Afro–Eurasian. Our divergence‐time analyses show that most of the extant
    species diversity has arisen from diversiﬁcation after the Oligocene despite
    a Cretaceous origin of the genus. Ancestral area reconstruction revealed
    that vicariance likely played a major role in building biogeographic
    patterns at deep evolutionary scales (the Afro–Eurasian clade and the
    American clade) in Hymenasplenium, while the intercontinental disjunctions
    within the Afro–Eurasian clade among Asia, Africa, and Oceania might have
    resulted from frequent long‐distance dispersal events from Asia to Oceania
    and Africa.

    As the second most genera-rich fern family, Pteridaceae contain more than
    1000 species contributing to ca. 10% of extant leptosporangiate fern
    diversity. The subfamily Pteridoideae is one of the five subfamilies often
    recognized. The circumscription of Pteridoideae has not been clear. A large
    number of species have not yet been included in any molecular analyses
    before. In this study, DNA sequences of six plastid loci of 154 accessions
    representing ca. 87 species in 14 genera of Pteridaceae subfam. Pteridoideae
    and four accessions representing two species in subfam. Parkerioideae and
    one species of subfam. Adiantoideae as outgroups were used to infer a
    phylogeny using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Our analyses show
    that (1) Pteridoideae is monophyletic and the newly defined subfamily is
    composed of 14 genera including a newly described genus; (2) Pteridoideae is
    resolved into four strongly supported monophyletic clades: the Pteris clade,
    the Actiniopteris + Onychium clade, the JAPSTT clade, and the GAPCC clade,
    these being supported by not only molecular data but also morphological
    features and distribution information; (3) Onychium is confirmed as
    monophyletic and accessions of Onychium are resolved into two strongly
    supported clades, the O. cryptogrammoides clade and the O. siliculosum
    clade; and (4) Accessions of the traditionally defined Anogramma are
    resolved as paraphyletic in relation to Cerosora, Cosentinica, and
    Pityrogramma. Three species traditionally treated in Anogramma are in fact
    more closely related to Cerosora and Pityrogramma than they are to
    Anogramma. Gastoniella Li Bing Zhang & Liang Zhang, gen. nov. is described
    to accommodate these species and three new combinations are provided. Three
    currently known species of Gastoniella are distributed in the Ascension
    Island in South Atlantic Ocean, central Mexico, and tropical America,
    respectively. The new genus is distinct from Anogramma s.s. in having
    ultimate segments linear not obviously broadening toward the upper portion.
