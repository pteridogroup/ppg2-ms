    Abstract
                
                  Background and Aims
                  The sensitive fern, Onoclea sensibilis, is a widespread species in eastern North America and has an atypical timing of spore dispersal among temperate ferns. During early summer, this dimorphic species produces heavily modified spore-bearing fronds with leaflets tightly enveloping their sporangia and spores. These fronds senesce and persist above ground as dead mature structures until the following early spring when the leaflets finally open and spores are dispersed. While this timing of spore dispersal has been observed for over 120 years, the structural mechanisms underpinning this phenology have remained elusive.
                
                
                  Methods
                  Based on field observations, growth chamber manipulations and scanning electron microscopy, the mechanisms underlying this distinctive timing of spore dispersal in the sensitive fern were investigated.
                
                
                  Key Results
                  I show that fertile leaflets of the sensitive fern move in direct response to changes in humidity, exhibiting structural and functional parallels with multicellular hygromorphic structures in seed plants, such as pine cones. These parallels include differences in cellulose microfibril orientation in cells on the abaxial and adaxial sides of the leaflet. The dynamics of this hygroscopic movement concomitant with regular abscission zones along the pinnules and coordinated senescence lead to the specific timing of early spring spore dispersal in the sensitive fern.
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  While hygroscopic movement is common in seed-free plants, it mostly occurs in small structures that are either one or a few cells in size, such as the leptosporangium. Given its multicellular structure and integration across many cells and tissues, the movement and construction of the sensitive fern pinnules are more similar to structures in seed plants. The evolution of this complex trait in the sensitive fern efficiently regulates the timing of spore release, leading to early spring dispersal. This phenology likely gives gametophytes and subsequent sporophytes an advantage with early germination and growth.

    Resource allocation theory posits that organisms distribute limited
    resources across functions to maximize their overall fitness. In plants, the
    allocation of resources among maintenance, reproduction, and growth
    influences short-term economics and long-term evolutionary processes,
    especially during resource scarcity. The evolution of specialized structures
    to divide labor between reproduction and growth can create a feedback loop
    where selection can act on individual organs, further increasing
    specializaton and resource allocation. Ferns exhibit diverse reproductive
    strategies, including dimorphism, where leaves can either be sterile (only
    for photosynthesis) or fertile (for spore dispersal). This dimorphism is
    similar to processes in seed plants (e.g., the production of fertile flowers
    and sterile leaves), and presents an opportunity to investigate divergent
    resource allocation between reproductive and vegetative functions in
    specialized organs. Here, we conducted anatomical and hydraulic analyses on
    Onoclea sensibilis L., a widespread dimorphic fern species, to reveal
    significant structural and hydraulic divergences between fertile and sterile
    leaves. Fertile fronds invest less in hydraulic architecture, with nearly
    1.5 times fewer water-conducting cells and a nearly 0.5 times less
    drought-resistant xylem compared to sterile fronds. This comes at the
    increased relative investment in structural support, which may help
    facilitate spore dispersal. These findings suggest that specialization in
    ferns—in the form of reproductive dimorphism—can enable independent
    selection pressures on each leaf type, potentially optimizing spore
    dispersal in fertile fronds and photosynthetic efficiency in sterile fronds.
    Overall, our study sheds light on the evolutionary implications of
    functional specialization and highlights the importance of reproductive
    strategies in shaping plant fitness and evolution.

    Phylogenetic conﬂicts limit our understanding of the evolution of
    terrestrial life under multiple whole genome duplication events, and the
    phylogeny of early terrestrial plants remains full of controversy. Although
    much incongruence has been solved with so-called robust topology based on
    single or lower copy genes, the evolutionary mechanisms behind phylogenetic
    conﬂicts such as polyploidization remain poorly understood. Here, through
    decreasing the effects of polyploidization and increasing the samples of
    species, which represent all four orders and eight families that comprise
    early leptosporangiate ferns, we have reconstructed a robust phylogenetic
    tree and network with 1125 1-to-1 orthologs based on both coalescent and
    concatenation methods. Our data consistently suggest that Matoniales, as a
    monophyletic lineage including Matoniaceae and Dipteridaceae, should be
    redeﬁned as an ordinal rank. Furthermore, we have identiﬁed and located at
    least 11 whole-genome duplication events within the evolutionary history of
    four leptosporangiates lineages, and associated polyploidization with higher
    speciation rates and mass extinction events. We hypothesize that
    paleopolyploidization may have enabled leptosporangiate ferns to survive
    during mass extinction events at the end Permian period and then ﬂourish
    throughout the Mesozoic era, which is supported by extensive fossil records.
    Our results highlight how ancient polyploidy can result in rapid species
    radiation, thus causing phylogenetic conﬂicts yet allowing plants to survive
    and thrive during mass extinction events.

    The aquatic invasive plant species Eichhornia crassipes and Salvinia molesta
    originated in the Neotropics (Bolenz et al., 1990; Tipping and Center,
    2005). Based on environmental, economic and human problems, E. crassipes and
    S. molesta are ranked first and second places respectively on a list of the
    world’s most problematic aquatic weeds (Holm et al., 1977; Barrett, 1989).
    This review paper presents the impacts of these two species on the
    environment, mainly in aquatic ecosystems of the tropics and subtropics, and
    also their use in societies and agro-industry with particular reference to
    their distribution and environmental impacts in ecosystems.

    The ultrastructure of the spore surface of 6 species Cystopteris Bernh.
    subgenus Cystopteris (Cystopteridaceae): C. almaatensis Kotukhov, C.
    altajensis Gureeva, C. dickieana R. Sim, C. fragilis (L.) Bernh. C. gureevae
    Stepanov, C. protrusa (Weatherby) Blasdell was investigated by using of
    scanning electron microscopy. On the basis of differences in sculpture 2
    types of perispore were distinguished: large-spiny persipore (C. altajensis,
    C. gureevae, C. fragilis, C. protrusa) and rugose perispore (C. almaatensis
    and C. dickieana). Large-spiny perispore is characterized by high, more or
    less sparse, hollow, conical-shaped spines, sometimes with curved tops of
    1.5–7.7 µm in height. Rugose perispore is represented by quite wide, short,
    hollow, sinuous folds 6–5,9 µm in height that densely covered with verrucae
    (warts). Size of spores varies within 21.1–61.3 × 21.1–45.1 µm. Spores of C.
    protrusa are characterized by minimum size (38.3 ± 7.8 × 26.7 ± 7.8 µm), but
    the longest spines (5.0 ± 0.8 µm). Maximum size of spores (52.1 ± 4.4 × 33.8
    ± 3.4 µm) and the shortest spines (3.8 ± 0.9 µm) were shown for C. gureevae.

    Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongn is a tetraploid fern species that
    contains at least three cryptic species, the south, the north and the third
    type. In this study we combined data from both chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and
    nuclear DNA sequences of three diploid species and three cryptic species of
    C. thalictroides to unravel the origin of the cryptic species, particularly
    of the reticulate relationships among the diploid and tetraploid taxa in the
    genus Ceratopteris. Of the three diploid species examined, C. cornuta had
    cpDNA identical to that of the tetraploid third type plants, and this
    diploid species is a possible maternal ancestor of the tetraploid third
    type. Analysis of the homologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana LEAFY gene
    (CLFY1) identified ten alleles in the genus Ceratopteris, with six alleles
    found in C. thalictroides. The unrooted tree of the CLFY1 gene revealed four
    clusters. Each cryptic species showed fixed heterozygosity at the CLFY1
    locus and had two alleles from different clusters of the CLFY1 tree.
    Consideration of the cpDNA sequences, CLFY1 genotypes of the cryptic species
    and CLFY1 gene tree in concert suggested that the cryptic species of C.
    thalictroides had originated through independent allopolyploidization events
    involving C. cornuta and two unknown hypothetical diploid species.

                  K). Nutrients were supplied daily with the same volumes for the six different nutrient solutions at exponentially increasing rates corresponding to a maximum relative growth rate (RGR) of 12.5% from days 0 to 31 and 6% from days 32 to 48. RGR was calculated for the highest N and K rate. Photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance to water vapor were determined on day 48, then the plants were harvested. The fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) of different plant components were determined. Shade completely inhibited growth of tubers and fertile shoots and drastically reduced RGR, average aerial shoot height, and DW of shoots and rhizomes. N supplied at the high rate to unshaded plants increased the growth of all parts or the plant except fertile shoots and tubers. No effects of K were detected at the low N rate, whereas at the high N rate, K significantly increased total DW and belowsurface DW. RGR never exceeded 10% d

    Are ferns in arid environments underestimated? Contribution from the Saharan

  abstract: >-
    Giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a problematic aquatic fern found in
    wetlands. Recently, severe infestation of the weed has been observed in the
    low-lying rice ﬁelds in India. An experiment was conducted at Kerala
    Agricultural University to investigate the effectiveness of different rice
    herbicides and soil amendments for managing salvinia. The trials were
    conducted in tanks, and a few effective herbicides were subsequently tested
    in the ﬁeld. Changes in major water quality parameters were also monitored.
    The tank study comprised 15 treatments; lime and gypsum (each at 0.1 kg/m2),
    acetic acid, salicylic acid, NaCl, and CuSO4, (each at 5% strength), and
    rice herbicides such as carfentrazone-ethyl (0.02 and 0.04 kg/ha), 2,4-D
    amine (1 kg/ha), cyhalofop-butyl + penoxsulam (0.15 kg/ha),
    ﬂorpyrauxifen-benzyl + cyhalofop-butyl (0.15 kg/ha), butachlor + penoxsulam
    (0.82 kg/ha), glufosinate-ammonium (0.3 and 0.5 kg/ha) along with an
    untreated check. In tank study, glufosinate-ammonium, carfentrazone-ethyl,
    cyhalofop-butyl + penoxsulam, ﬂorpyrauxifen-benzyl + cyhalofop-butyl,
    butachlor + penoxsulam, acetic acid, salicylic acid, and CuSO4 gave more
    than 80% salvinia control. However, regrowth was observed in acetic acid,
    salicylic acid, and CuSO4. Under ﬁeld conditions, the weed control efﬁciency
    of all the treatments were more than 80%. Salvinia competition resulted in
    55% reduction in rice grain yield. Though noticeable changes in water pH and
    EC were observed after applying lime, gypsum, and CuSO4, these alterations
    did not suppress the salvinia growth. Effective management of salvinia
    infestation in wetland rice can be achieved through post-emergent spray of
    premix herbicides; ﬂorpyrauxifen-benzyl + cyhalofop-butyl, cyhalofop-butyl +
    penoxsulam, pretilachlor + pyrazosulfuron ethyl, butachlor + penoxsulam, or
    carfentrazone-ethyl or ﬂorpyrauxifen-benzyl, along with a wetting agent. For
    pre-plant control glufosinate-ammonium is a suitable herbicide.

    Adiantopsis Fe´e (Pteridaceae) is a relatively unstudied tropical
    cheilanthoid fern genus. In the present work, we evaluated the taxonomy and
    relationships among Caribbean Adiantopsis by examining 136 characters from
    approximately 500 herbarium specimens. This study identified nine Caribbean
    Adiantopsis species, three of which are newly described (A. parvisegmenta,
    A. pentagona, and A. vincentii). Additionally, an intriguing pattern of
    morphological and reticulate evolution was revealed by the analyses.
    Adiantopsis consists of three different laminar morphologies; palmate,
    pedate, and pinnate. The two pedate taxa are hypothesized to be fertile
    allotetraploid derivatives of the palmate A. radiata (L.) Fe´e and two
    different pinnate taxa. In this regard they parallel the origin of the South
    American A. 3australopedata Hickey, M. S. Barker & Ponce. Based on our
    analyses, it appears that pedate laminar morphologies in Adiantopsis
    independently originated multiple times via hybridization. This study
    provides testable hypotheses of morphological and reticulate evolution in
    the genus and presents a novel view of Caribbean Adiantopsis.

    A diploids-first approach to species delimitation and interpreting polyploid

  abstract: >-
    Polyploidy presents a challenge to those wishing to delimit the species
    within a group and reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among these
    taxa. A clear understanding of the tree-like relationships among the diploid
    species can provide a framework upon which to reconstruct the reticulate
    events that gave rise to the polyploid lineages. In this study we apply this
    “diploids-first” strategy to the fern genus Astrolepis (Pteridaceae).
    Diploids are identified using the number of spores per sporangium and spore
    size. Analyses of plastid and low-copy nuclear sequence data provide
    well-supported estimates of phylogenetic relationships, including strong
    evidence for two morphologically distinctive diploid lineages not recognized
    in recent treatments. One of these corresponds to the type of Notholaena
    deltoidea, a species that has not been recognized in any modern treatment of
    Astrolepis. This species is resurrected here as the new combination
    Astrolepis deltoidea. The second novel lineage is that of a diploid
    initially hypothesized to exist by molecular and morphological
    characteristics of several established Astrolepis allopolyploids. This
    previously missing diploid species is described here as Astrolepis obscura.

    Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Todaro populations that had been subjected to
    crozier harvesting over the past 25 yr were investigated. The number of
    crowns harvested and the number of croziers harvested per crown varied
    annually, but most crowns were harvested at least once over 5 yr. In 1995,
    total and 50% defoliation impacts were tested on subsequent years’ frond
    production in understorey and open site populations. The effect of mineral
    fertilization on the understorey population was also investigated. Crowns in
    the open habitat produced more fronds annually than the understorey crowns
    and were less susceptible to partial defoliation. One year with total
    defoliation was sufficient to significantly reduce the number of fronds
    produced in both habitats over the next 4 yr. Defoliated crowns also
    accumulated less carbohydrates at the end of the first season. Mineral
    fertilization increased the number of fronds produced the following year but
    had no long-term benefit and did not significantly alleviate defoliation
    effects. Despite the fact that harvesting intensity was relatively low, it
    appears necessary to limit crozier harvesting per crown to less than 50% in
    understorey populations to preserve wild populations of M. struthiopteris.

    It has been noted that there is no definite correlation between spore-size
    and the level of polyploidy in the Hamalayan members of Asplenium,
    Cystopteris, Athyrium, and Diplazium. On the basis of average spore-size it
    is practically impossible to surmise the grade of polyploidy of a particular
    species, since several tetraploid species of Asplenium, Diplazium, and
    Athyrium show spores smaller than the diploid ones. However, within a
    'species complex' with differen tcytotypes, the increase in the level of
    poloidy is always associated with a corresponding increase in the size of
    the spore. this may prove useful in plotting out from herbarium material the
    distribution of various cytotypes.

    Hybridisation can lead to reproductive isolation and consequently
    speciation. It has been proposed to play an important role in fern
    evolution, but has been difficult to investigate. This study explores the
    utility of target sequence capture and reference guided read phasing to
    investigate the role of evolutionary reticulation in ferns using Australian
    Thelypteridaceae as a model. The bioinformatics workflow HybPhaser was used
    to assess divergence between alleles, phase sequence reads to references to
    construct accessions resembling parental haplotpes, and include them in
    phylogenetic and network analyses to detect hybrids and parentage. This
    approach identified two novel hybrid lineages in Thelypteridaceae, one
    occurring between two different genera ( Abacopteris and Christella ), and
    provided evidence that reticulation is likely to have played an important
    role in the diversification of Australian thelypterids. In addition, hybrid
    phasing successfully reduced conflicting data and improved overall
    resolution in the Thelypteridaceae phylogeny, highlighting the power of this
    approach for reconstructing evolutionary history in reticulated lineages.

    Abstract
                It is time to synthesize the knowledge that has been generated through more than 260 years of botanical exploration, taxonomic and, more recently, phylogenetic research throughout the world. The adoption of an updated Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) in 2011 provided the essential impetus for the development of the World Flora Online (WFO) project. The project represents an international, coordinated effort by the botanical community to achieve GSPC Target 1, an electronic Flora of all plants. It will be a first‐ever unique and authoritative global source of information on the world's plant diversity, compiled, curated, moderated and updated by an expert and specialist‐based community (Taxonomic Expert Networks – “TENs” – covering a taxonomic group such as family or order) and actively managed by those who have compiled and contributed the data it includes. Full credit and acknowledgement will be given to the original sources, allowing users to refer back to the primary data. A strength of the project is that it is led and endorsed by a global consortium of more than 40 leading botanical institutions worldwide. A first milestone for producing the World Flora Online is to be accomplished by the end of 2020, but the WFO Consortium is committed to continuing the WFO programme beyond 2020 when it will develop its full impact as the authoritative source of information on the world's plant biodiversity.

    The legacy of deliberate and accidental introductions of invasive alien
    species to Australia has had a hefty economic toll, yet quantifying the
    magnitude of the costs associated with direct loss and damage, as well as
    for management interventions, remains elusive. This is because the
    reliability of cost estimates and under-sampling have not been determined.
    We provide the first detailed analysis of the reported costs associated with
    invasive species to the Australian economy since the 1960s, based on the
    recently published InvaCost database and supplementary information, for a
    total of 2078 unique cost entries. Since the 1960s, Australia has spent or
    incurred losses totalling at least US$298.58 billion (2017 value) or
    AU$389.59 billion (2017 average exchange rate) from invasive species.
    However, this is an underestimate given that costs rise as the number of
    estimates increases following a power law. There was an average 1.8–6.3-fold
    increase in the total costs per decade since the 1970s to the present,
    producing estimated costs of US$6.09–57.91 billion year
                  -1
                  (all costs combined) or US$225.31 million–6.84 billion year
                  -1
                  (observed, highly reliable costs only). Costs arising from plant species were the highest among kingdoms (US$151.68 billion), although most of the costs were not attributable to single species. Of the identified weedy species, the costliest were annual ryegrass (
                  Lolium rigidum
                  ), parthenium (
                  Parthenium hysterophorus
                  ) and ragwort (
                  Senecio jacobaea
                  ). The four costliest classes were mammals (US$48.63 billion), insects (US$11.95 billion), eudicots (US$4.10 billion) and monocots (US$1.92 billion). The three costliest species were all animals – cats (
                  Felis catus
                  ), rabbits (
                  Oryctolagus cuniculus
                  ) and red imported fire ants (
                  Solenopsis invicta
                  ). Each State/Territory had a different suite of major costs by species, but with most (3–62%) costs derived from one to three species per political unit. Most (61%) of the reported costs applied to multiple environments and 73% of the total pertained to direct damage or loss compared to management costs only, with both of these findings reflecting the availability of data. Rising incursions of invasive species will continue to have substantial costs for the Australian economy, but with better investment, standardised assessments and reporting and coordinated interventions (including eradications), some of these costs could be substantially reduced.

    Abstract
                Disentangling phylogenetic relationships proves challenging for groups that have evolved recently, especially if there is ongoing reticulation. Although they are in most cases immediately isolated from diploid relatives, sets of sibling allopolyploids often hybridize with each other, thereby increasing the complexity of an already challenging situation. Dactylorhiza (Orchidaceae: Orchidinae) is a genus much affected by allopolyploid speciation and reticulate phylogenetic relationships. Here, we use genetic variation at tens of thousands of genomic positions to unravel the convoluted evolutionary history of Dactylorhiza. We first investigate circumscription and relationships of diploid species in the genus using coalescent and maximum likelihood methods, and then group 16 allotetraploids by maximum affiliation to their putative parental diploids, implementing a method based on genotype likelihoods. The direction of hybrid crosses is inferred for each allotetraploid using information from maternally inherited plastid RADseq loci. Starting from age estimates of parental taxa, the relative ages of these allotetraploid entities are inferred by quantifying their genetic similarity to the diploids and numbers of private alleles compared with sibling allotetraploids. Whereas northwestern Europe is dominated by young allotetraploids of postglacial origins, comparatively older allotetraploids are distributed further south, where climatic conditions remained relatively stable during the Pleistocene glaciations. Our bioinformatics approach should prove effective for the study of other naturally occurring, nonmodel, polyploid plant complexes.

    The distribution ofCystopteris fragilis andC. dickieana in Afghanistan
    within the Flora Iranica region is studied. The latter species, for some
    ecological reason, occurs more frequently at higher altitudes. In both taxa
    higher polyploid levels also occur at high altitudes. The phenomenon can be
    correlated with the boreal-arctic distribution pattern. Polyploidism and
    spore-size classes are briefly mentioned as well as possible ecological
    adaptations. Evolutionary differentiation within both taxa are complex and
    still unknown.

    Errors in the original illustration of megaspores of Isoetes taiwanensis De
    Vol invite confusion in regards to the identification and affinity of this
    rare Taiwan endemic. As a basic sexual diploid it is important to an
    understanding of the taxonomy and evolution of Isoetes in the western
    Pacific - Australasian area. A re-examination of a majority of the extant
    material for this species offers a series of SEM photographs of typical
    microspores and megaspores and explores its affinity with other Isoetes
    species. We conclude that I. taiwanensis is probably a member of a complex
    of high elevation, cold water, island species occurring along the western
    Pacific rim from New Zealand to Taiwan, with derivative polyploids in the
    Philippines and New Guinea. We do not believe it to be closely related to
    southwestern Australian taxa as has been previusly suggested. It appears to
    have closest affinity to I. kirkii A. Br., a diploid New Zealand endemic.
    There is also evidence that hybrids, although not previously reported from
    the southern hemisphere, are of regular occurrence amongst the Australian
    species. The Australian Isoetes drummondii A. Br. var. anomala Marsden is
    particularly likely to prove to be of hybrid origin.

    Summary
                
                  Heritable symbioses exist across eukaryotes with different degrees of intimacy. In most cases, the symbionts are obligate and require inheritance for their survival. On the host side, symbiont retention can facilitate fitness benefits. Only rarely are these symbioses interwoven to the point that host survival relies on the symbiont. In land plants, the symbiosis of the water fern
                  Azolla
                  with its symbiotic cyanobacterium shows such a degree of high co‐dependence. The symbiosis originated in the last common ancestor of
                  Azolla
                  and exists continuously for at least 60 million years with no evolutionarily stable, secondary loss of the symbiont reported. This is a feat achieved by interactions on an organellar‐like level or those considered recent organelle acquisitions. Yet,
                  Azolla
                  's symbiont is extracellular. How can loss of autonomy concomitant with full co‐dependence be accommodated in this extracellular symbiosis? Here, we synthesize what we know from the
                  Azolla
                  symbiosis on the consequences of evolutionary co‐dependence and stable symbiont retention. We discuss the need for symbiotic integration into environmental responsiveness if host survival depends on symbiont well‐being. Cross‐organismal integration of environmental stress responses may be one of the key steps that favor this evolutionarily stable permanent integration.

    The current understanding of fern phylogeny is primarily based on plastid
    and nuclear sequences, but the third genome—the mitogenome—has remained
    practically unstudied. We inferred the first broad scale fern phylogeny
    based on mitogenomic data, obtained from the One Thousand Plant
    Transcriptomes Initiative project, and compared it with the plastid
    phylogeny. The trees were mostly congruent and corresponded to the current
    understanding of the fern phylogeny, but we observed different evolutionary
    patterns between the two genomes. Protein-coding markers located in the
    plastome had, on average, over two times higher substitution rate than the
    markers from the mitogenome. The similar rate variation pattern between the
    genomes in different fern lineages supports the idea that a common
    mechanism, like life history traits, drives the rates of molecular
    evolution. The few conflicting nodes we observed have also been difficult to
    resolve in other studies, suggesting that even genomic data may not suffice
    to resolve them.

    Contributions to the knowledge of the aggregate Cystopteris fragilis in
    Spain. A study of the aggregate Cystopteris fragilis and C. alpina is
    carried out, seeking to know the relationships that can be established, due
    to macro and microcharacters, between the different types of general
    morphologies and the different levels of ploidy found (4x, 6x and 8x). The
    combination of the size of the exospory and the stomatal guard cells, allows
    us to distinguish the five taxa analyzed, although not always. To do this,
    we have analyzed 43 individuals spread across Spain, with a predominance of
    the Cantabrian area. Keywords: Pteridophyta; Cystopteris; Cystopteris
    fragilis; Cystopteridaceae; cytology; ploidy level; micromorphology; Spain.

    Reproductive traits of Pteris cadieri and P. grevilleana in Taiwan:
    Implications for their hybrid origin
  type: article-journal
  volume: '51'

- id: chao2012extreme
  abstract: >-
    The Pteris cadieri complex displays extensive morphological variation and
    seems to have originated through hybridization. However, the members of this
    complex reproduce by apogamy, which usually limits genetic variation. To
    evaluate the hypotheses of hybrid origins, the pattern of evolution in this
    species complex is reconstructed. Multiple methodologies were used.
    Diploids, triploids, and tetraploids were identified by chromosome counts
    and flow cytometry. Nuclear DNA markers (cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase
    gene, PgiC) were used, together with chloroplast DNA markers (atpB-rbcL
    spacer and rbcL gene) to infer the biparental and maternal lineages of the
    Pteris cadieri complex. The three cpDNA haplotype groups and five PgiC
    alleles found in this study indicate that the evolution of the Pteris
    cadieri complex has been extremely reticulate. Up to 11 taxa belonging to
    eight morphs were identified. By comparing genetic variation in the Pteris
    cadieri in two independent areas, Hainan and Taiwan, we inferred that
    hybridization has occurred independently in different areas. Furthermore, we
    found evidence for phenological divergence (evergreen and deciduous) within
    Taiwan. We propose that the Pteris cadieri complex originated from different
    genetic lineages through multiple hybridizations in different geographical
    areas, leading to its present morphological diversity.

  abstract: >-
    The Pteris cadieri complex is widely distributed in South and East Asia. Due
    to tremendous morphological variation within and between taxa, previous
    taxonomic treatments have been plagued with an element of uncertainty. In
    this study, the morphological characteristics, along with data from previous
    studies on reproductive modes, cytology, and genotypes, are integrated to
    clarify and delineate each taxon. Nine taxa are recognized in the Pteris
    cadieri complex: three original species (P. cadieri, P. hainanensis and P.
    grevilleana), one reinstated name (P. dimorpha, synonymized under P.
    cadieri), two new species (P. incurvata sp. nov. and P. perplexa sp. nov.),
    two new varieties (P. dimorpha var. prolongata var. nov., and P. dimorpha
    var. metagrevilleana var. nov.), and a forma (P. grevilleana f. ornata stat.
    nov.). The lectotypes of P. cadieri, P. dimorpha, P. grevilleana, and P.
    hainanensis are designated. Each taxon is described in detail. A key is
    provided to facilitate the identification of all taxa.

  abstract: >-
    Davallia repens and its close relatives have been identified as a species
    complex in this study because of the existence of continuously morphological
    variation. To decipher its evolutionary history, integrated methodologies
    were applied in this study including morphology, cytology, reproductive
    biology and molecular phylogeny. Analysis of morphological characters
    reveals several important discriminating characteristics, such as the shape
    of stipe scales, frond and indusium. Both diploid and polyploid forms are
    present in the complex and reproduce sexually and by apogamy, respectively.
    The incongruence between cpDNA and nDNA phylogeny indicates a hybrid origin
    for most polyploid individuals. Based on the present results, we hypothesize
    that there were at least two ancestral lineages distributed in the Malesian
    region. Through hybridization, polyploidization and apogamy, some polyploid
    genotypes dispersed outwards to shape the extant distribution.

    © 2017, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan KK. The
    phylogenetic affinities of the fern genus Aenigmopteris have been the
    subject of considerable disagreement, but until now, no molecular data were
    available from the genus. Based on the analysis of three chloroplast DNA
    regions (rbcL, rps16-matK, and trnL-F) we demonstrate that Aenigmopteris
    dubia (the type species of the genus) and A. elegans are closely related and
    deeply imbedded in Tectaria. The other three species of genus are
    morphologically very similar; we therefore transfer all five known species
    into Tectaria. Detailed morphological comparison further shows that
    previously proposed diagnostic characters of Aenigmopteris fall within the
    range of variation of a broadly circumscribed Tectaria.

    Accumulating evidence suggests that speciation often resembles a reticulate
    network rather than a bifurcating process. In ferns, which possess
    independent gametophyte and sporophyte phases, reticulate evolution is
    common, especially where sporophytes of congeneric species co-occur.
    However, the role of long-lived gametophytes that distribute beyond their
    sporophytic counterparts in facilitating reticulate evolution remains
    underexplored.

    The transition from aquatic to terrestrial eggs is a key evolutionary change
    that has allowed vertebrates to successfully colonize and exploit the land.
    Although most amphibians retain the primitive biphasic life cycle (eggs
    deposited in water that hatch into free-living aquatic larvae), direct
    development of terrestrial eggs has evolved repeatedly and may have been
    critical to the evolutionary success of several amphibian groups. We provide
    the ﬁrst conclusive evidence for evolutionary reversal of direct development
    in vertebrates. The family Plethodontidae (lungless salamanders) contains
    the majority of salamander species, including major radiations of direct
    developers. We reconstruct the higher level phylogenetic relationships of
    plethodontid salamanders using molecular and morphological data and use this
    phylogeny to examine the evolution of direct development. We show that the
    predominantly biphasic desmognathines, previously considered the sister
    group of other plethodontids, are nested inside a group of directdeveloping
    species (Plethodontini) and have re-evolved the aquatic larval stage. Rather
    than being an evolutionary dead end, the reversal from direct developing to
    biphasic life history may have helped communities in eastern North America
    to achieve the highest local diversity of salamander species in the world.

    The phylogenetic position of Dracoglossum Christenh. is studied here for the
    first time using DNA sequence data. Based on a broad sampling of eupolypod
    ferns and four plastid genes (atpA, atpB, rbcL, rps4), we show that
    Dracoglossum does not belong to the genus Tectaria Cav., in which it was
    previously placed, nor is it closely related to that genus or any other
    member of Tectariaceae. Our results provide strong support to suggest that
    Dracoglossum forms a rather isolated lineage, which is sister to Lomariopsis
    Fe´e, and that the genus should therefore be placed in Lomariopsidaceae.

  abstract: >-
    Background and Aims Throughout the history of fern classification, familial
    and generic concepts have been highly labile. Many classifications and
    evolutionary schemes have been proposed during the last two centuries,
    reflecting different interpretations of the available evidence. Knowledge of
    fern structure and life histories has increased through time, providing more
    evidence on which to base ideas of possible relationships, and
    classification has changed accordingly. This paper reviews previous
    classifications of ferns and presents ideas on how to achieve a more stable
    consensus. Scope An historical overview is provided from the first to the
    most recent fern classifications, from which conclusions are drawn on past
    changes and future trends. The problematic concept of family in ferns is
    discussed, with a particular focus on how this has changed over time. The
    history of molecular studies and the most recent findings are also
    presented. Key Results Fern classification generally shows a trend from
    highly artificial, based on an interpretation of a few extrinsic characters,
    via natural classifications derived from a multitude of intrinsic
    characters, towards more evolutionary circumscriptions of groups that do not
    in general align well with the distribution of these previously used
    characters. It also shows a progression from a few broad family concepts to
    systems that recognized many more narrowly and highly controversially
    circumscribed families; currently, the number of families recognized is
    stabilizing somewhere between these extremes. Placement of many genera was
    uncertain until the arrival of molecular phylogenetics, which has rapidly
    been improving our understanding of fern relationships. As a collective
    category, the so-called 'fern allies' (e.g. Lycopodiales, Psilotaceae,
    Equisetaceae) were unsurprisingly found to be polyphyletic, and the term
    should be abandoned. Lycopodiaceae, Selaginellaceae and Isoëtaceae form a
    clade (the lycopods) that is sister to all other vascular plants, whereas
    the whisk ferns (Psilotaceae), often included in the lycopods or believed to
    be associated with the first vascular plants, are sister to Ophioglossaceae
    and thus belong to the fern clade. The horsetails (Equisetaceae) are also
    members of the fern clade (sometimes inappropriately called 'monilophytes'),
    but, within that clade, their placement is still uncertain. Leptosporangiate
    ferns are better understood, although deep relationships within this group
    are still unresolved. Earlier, almost all leptosporangiate ferns were placed
    in a single family (Polypodiaceae or Dennstaedtiaceae), but these families
    have been redefined to narrower more natural entities. Conclusions
    Concluding this paper, a classification is presented based on our current
    understanding of relationships of fern and lycopod clades. Major changes in
    our understanding of these families are highlighted, illustrating issues of
    classification in relation to convergent evolution and false homologies.
    Problems with the current classification and groups that still need study
    are pointed out. A summary phylogenetic tree is also presented. A new
    classification in which Aspleniaceae, Cyatheaceae, Polypodiaceae and
    Schizaeaceae are expanded in comparison with the most recent classifications
    is presented, which is a modification of those proposed by Smith et al.
    (2006, 2008) and Christenhusz et al. (2011). These classifications are now
    finding a wider acceptance and use, and even though a few amendments are
    made based on recently published results from molecular analyses, we have
    aimed for a stable family and generic classification of ferns.

  abstract: >-
    Owing to some discrepancies among old and new literature dealing with
    Cystopteris in P o r t u g a l , Azores, M a d e i r a and C a n a r y
    Islands, t h e A. decided to m a k e a full revision of th e m a t t e r .
    So, all t he available specimens, in Portuguese herbaria as well as in the
    British Museum (Natural History), London, and the Royal Botanic Gardens,
    Kew, were carefully studied (including spore observation at the scanning
    microscope); some field research w a s also done. A s t h e result of all
    this work, t h e A. concluded t h a t the Cystopteris specimens checked
    should be placed into t h e t h r e e following species: 1) C. fragilis (L.)
    Bernh.; 2) C. dickieana R. Sim; a n d C. viridula (Desv.) Desv. Hence, C.
    fragilis seems n o w restricted to a f e w m ountain places in N E P o r t u
    g a l , above 700 m altitude; C. dickieana, now mentioned f o r Portugal for
    the first time, seems to be more commoner in the same area, above 600 m ( r
    a r e l y coming down till 200 m in its m o r e w e s t e r n p a r t of t h
    e range, in t h e D ouro valley); and C. viridula (commonly r e f e r r e d
    by other a u t h o r s a s C. diaphana) is th e commonest species in P o r t
    u g a l , f r o m the sea-level to ca. 950 m, and the sole found in the
    Azores and Madeira, as well as in the Canary Islands.

  abstract: >-
    © 2017 Elsevier Inc. Polyploidy is a major speciation process in vascular
    plants, and is postulated to be particularly important in shaping the
    diversity of extant ferns. However, limitations in the availability of
    bi-parental markers for ferns have greatly limited phylogenetic
    investigation of polyploidy in this group. With a large number of
    allopolyploid species, the genus Botrychium is a classic example in ferns
    where recurrent polyploidy is postulated to have driven frequent speciation
    events. Here, we use PacBio sequencing and the PURC bioinformatics pipeline
    to capture all homeologous or allelic copies of four long (∼1 kb) low-copy
    nuclear regions from a sample of 45 specimens (25 diploids and 20
    polyploids) representing 37 Botrychium taxa, and three outgroups. This
    sample includes most currently recognized Botrychium species in Europe and
    North America, and the majority of our specimens were genotyped with
    co-dominant nuclear allozymes to ensure species identification. We analyzed
    the sequence data using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI)
    concatenated-data (“gene tree”) approaches to explore the relationships
    among Botrychium species. Finally, we estimated divergence times among
    Botrychium lineages and inferred the multi-labeled polyploid species tree
    showing the origins of the polyploid taxa, and their relationships to each
    other and to their diploid progenitors. We found strong support for the
    monophyly of the major lineages within Botrychium and identified most of the
    parental donors of the polyploids; these results largely corroborate earlier
    morphological and allozyme-based investigations. Each polyploid had at least
    two distinct homeologs, indicating that all sampled polyploids are likely
    allopolyploids (rather than autopolyploids). Our divergence-time analyses
    revealed that these allopolyploid lineages originated recently—within the
    last two million years—and thus that the genus has undergone a recent
    radiation, correlated with multiple independent allopolyploidizations across
    the phylogeny. Also, we found strong parental biases in the formation of
    allopolyploids, with individual diploid species participating multiple times
    as either the maternal or paternal donor (but not both). Finally, we discuss
    the role of polyploidy in the evolutionary history of Botrychium and the
    interspecific reproductive barriers possibly involved in these parental
    biases.

    An index of chromosome numbers for New Zealand pteridophytes is presented.
    The list includes all known chromosome counts, fiom published sources and
    unpublished reports and theses, of ferns and fern allies indigenous to the
    New Zealand Botanical Region. Full references to the original reports are
    provided. Chromosome numbers are listed for 137 species of ferns and 7 fern
    allies out of a total New Zealand pteridophyte flora of 188
    describedspecies. This represents about 77%of the total. Only about 2% of
    New Zealand pteridophytes are believed to be apomictic.

  abstract: >-
    Bracken ferns (genus Pteridium) represent an ancient species complex with a
    natural worldwide distribution. Pteridium has historically been treated as
    comprising a single species, but recent treatments have recognized several
    related species. Phenotypic plasticity, geographically structured
    morphological variation, and geographically biased sampling have all
    contributed to taxonomic confusion in the genus. We sampled bracken
    specimens worldwide and used variable regions of the chloroplast genome to
    investigate phylogeography and reticulate evolution within the genus. Our
    results distinguish two major clades within Pteridium, a primarily northern
    hemisphere Laurasian/African clade, which includes all taxa currently
    assigned to P. aquilinum, and a primarily southern hemisphere Austral/South
    American clade, which includes P. esculentum and P. arachnoideum. All
    European accessions of P. aquilinum subsp. aquilinum appear in a
    monophyletic group and are nested within a clade containing the African P.
    aquilinum taxa (P. aquilinum subsp. capense and P. aquilinum subsp.
    centrali-africanum). Our results allow us to hypothesize the maternal
    progenitors of two allotetraploid bracken species, P. caudatum and P.
    semihastatum. We also discuss the biogeography of bracken in the context of
    the chloroplast phylogeny. Our study is one of the first to take a worldwide
    perspective in addressing variation in a broadly distributed species
    complex.

    character, because they involve a few species and do not ensure full lifting

  abstract: >-
    Equisetum is a small and morphologically distinct genus with a rich fossil
    record. Two subgenera have been recognized based principally on stomatal
    position and stem branching: subg. Equisetum (eight species; superficial
    stomates; stems branched) and subg. Hippochaete (seven species; sunken
    stomates; stems generally unbranched). Prior attempts at understanding
    Equisetum systematics, phylogeny, and character evolution have been hampered
    by the high degree of morphological plasticity in the genus as well as by
    frequent hybridization among members within each subgenus. We present the
    first explicit phylogenetic study of Equisetum, including all 15 species and
    two samples of one widespread hybrid, Equisetum X ferrissii, based on a
    combined analysis of two chloroplast markers, rbcL and trnL-F. Our robustly
    supported phylogeny identifies two monophyletic clades corresponding to the
    two subgenera recognized by earlier workers. The phylogenetic placement of
    Equisetum bogotense, however, is ambiguous. In maximum likelihood analyses,
    it allies with subg. Hippochaete as the most basal member, while maximum
    parsimony places it as sister to the rest of the genus. A consensus
    phylogeny from the two analyses is presented as a basal trichotomy (E.
    bogotense, subg. Hippochaete, subg. Equisetum), and morphological character
    evolution is discussed. We detected rate heterogeneity in the rbcL locus
    between the two subgenera that can be attributed to an increased rate of
    nucleotide substitution (trans-versions) in subg. Hippochaete. We calculated
    molecular-based age estimates using the penalized likelihood approach, which
    accounts for rate heterogeneity and does not assume a molecular clock. The
    Equisetum crown group appears to have diversified in the early Cenozoic,
    whereas the Equisetaceae total group is estimated to have a Paleozoic
    origin. These molecular-based age estimates are in remarkable agreement with
    current interpretations of the fossil record.

    Comprising about 82% of the extant fern species diversity, Polypodiales are
    generally believed to have diversiﬁed in the Late Cretaceous. We estimated
    the divergence times of Polypodiales using both penalized likelihood and
    Bayesian methods, based on a dataset consisting of 208 plastomes
    representing all 28 families and 14 fossil constraints reﬂecting current
    interpretations of fossil record. Our plastome phylogeny recovered the same
    six major lineages as a recent nuclear phylogeny, but the position of
    Dennstaedtiineae was different. The present phylogeny showed high resolution
    of relationships among the families of Polypodiales, especially among those
    forming the Aspleniineae. The divergence time estimates supported the most
    recent common ancestor of Polypodiales and its closest relative dating back
    to the Triassic, establishment of the major lineages in the Jurassic, and a
    likely accelerated radiation during the late Jurassic and the Early
    Cretaceous. The estimated divergence patterns of Polypodiales and
    angiosperms converge to a scenario in which their main lineages were
    established simultaneously shortly before the onset of the Cretaceous
    Terrestrial Revolution, and further suggest a pre-Cretaceous hidden history
    for both lineages. The pattern of simultaneous diversiﬁcations shown here
    elucidate an important gap in our understanding of the Terrestrial
    Revolution that shaped today’s ecosystems.

    Structural variation of plastid genomes (plastomes), particularly large
    inversions and gene losses, can provide key evidence for the deep phylogeny
    of plants. In this study, we investigated the structural variation of fern
    plastomes in a phylogenetic context. A total of 127 plastomes representing
    all 50 recognized families and 11 orders of ferns were sampled, making it
    the most comprehensive plastomic analysis of fern lineages to date. The
    samples included 42 novel plastomes of 15 families with a focus on
    Hymenophyllales and Gleicheniales. We reconstructed a well-supported
    phylogeny of all extant fern families, detected significant structural
    synapomorphies, including 9 large inversions, 7 invert repeat region (IR)
    boundary shifts, 10 protein-coding gene losses, 7 tRNA gene losses or
    anticodon changes, and 19 codon indels (insertions or deletions) across the
    deep phylogeny of ferns, particularly on the backbone nodes. The newly
    identified inversion V5, together with the newly inferred expansion of the
    IR boundary R5, can be identified as a synapomorphy of a clade composed of
    Dipteridaceae, Matoniaceae, Schizaeales, and the core leptosporangiates,
    while a unique inversion V4, together with an expansion of the IR boundary
    R4, was verified as a synapomorphy of Gleicheniaceae. This structural
    evidence is in support of our phylogenetic inference, thus providing key
    insight into the paraphyly of Gleicheniales. The inversions of V5 and V7
    together filled the crucial gap regarding how the “reversed” gene
    orientation in the IR region characterized by most extant ferns (Schizaeales
    and the core leptosporangiates) evolved from the inferred ancestral type as
    retained in Equisetales and Osmundales. The tRNA genes
                  trnR-ACG
                  and
                  trnM-CAU
                  were assumed to be relicts of the early-divergent fern lineages but intact in most Polypodiales, particularly in eupolypods; and the loss of the tRNA genes
                  trnR-CCG, trnV-UAC
                  , and
                  trnR-UCU
                  in fern plastomes was much more prevalent than previously thought. We also identified several codon indels in protein-coding genes within the core leptosporangiates, which may be identified as synapomorphies of specific families or higher ranks. This study provides an empirical case of integrating structural and sequence information of plastomes to resolve deep phylogeny of plants.

  abstract: >-
    In order to estimate evolutionary relationships within the filmy fern genus
    Trichomanes (Hymenophyllaceae), we performed a phylogenetic analysis using
    rbcL nucleotide data from 46 species of Trichomanes belonging to all four of
    C.V. Morton's subgenera: Achomanes, Didymoglossum, Pachychaetum, and
    Trichomanes. Outgroups included four species of Hymenophyllum in three
    different subgenera, plus the monotypic genus Cardiomanes, from New Zealand.
    We find high resolution and robust support at most nodes, regardless of the
    phylogenetic optimization criterion used (maximum parsimony or maximum
    likelihood). Two species belonging to Morton's Asiatic sections
    Callistopteris and Cephalomanes are in unresolved basal positions within
    Trichomanes s.l., suggesting that rbcL data alone are inadequate for
    estimating the earliest cladogenetic events. Out of the four Morton
    trichomanoid subgenera, only subg. Didymoglossum appears monophyletic. Other
    noteworthy results include the following: (1) lianescent sect. Lacostea is
    more closely related to sect. Davalliopsis (traditionally placed in subg.
    Pachychaetum) than to other members of subg. Achomanes; (2) sections
    Davalliopsis and Lacostea, together with species of the morphologically
    different subg. Achomanes, make up a strongly supported Neotropical clade;
    (3) all hemiepiphytes (but not true lianas) and strictly epiphytic or
    epipetric species (Morton's subgenera Trichomanes and Didymoglossum) group
    together in an ecologically definable clade that also includes the
    terrestrial sect. Nesopteris; and (4) sect. Lacosteopsis (sensu Morton) is
    polyphyletic and comprises two distantly related clades: large hemiepiphytic
    climbers and small strictly epiphytic/epipetric taxa. Each of these
    associations is somewhat unexpected but is supported by cytological,
    geographical, and/or ecological evidence. We conclude that many
    morphological characters traditionally used for delimiting groups within
    Trichomanes are, in part, plesiomorphic or homoplastic. Additionally, we
    discuss probable multiple origins of Neotropical Trichomanes.

  abstract: >-
    To infer the anatomical evolution of the Hymenophyllaceae (filmy ferns) and
    to test previously suggested scenarios of regressive evolution, we performed
    an exhaustive investigation of stem anatomy in the most variable lineage of
    the family, the trichomanoids, using a representative sampling of 50
    species. The evolution of qualitative and quantitative anatomical characters
    and possibly related growth-forms was analyzed using a maximum likelihood
    approach. Potential correlations between selected characters were then
    statistically tested using a phylogenetic comparative method. Our
    investigations support the anatomical homogeneity of this family at the
    generic and sub-generic levels. Reduced and sub-collateral/collateral steles
    likely derived from an ancestral massive protostele, and
    sub-collateral/collateral types appear to be related to stem thickness
    reduction and root apparatus regression. These results corroborate the
    hypothesis of regressive evolution in the lineage, in terms of morphology as
    well as anatomy. In addition, a heterogeneous cortex, which is derived in
    the lineage, appears to be related to a colonial strategy and likely to a
    climbing phenotype. The evolutionary hypotheses proposed in this study lay
    the ground for further evolutionary analyses that take into account
    trichomanoid habitats and accurate ecological preferences.

    This light and electron microscope study revealed that leptosporangiate
    ferns have highly distinctive gametophyte-sporophyte junctions characterized
    by sporophytic haustoria, the absence of intraplacental spaces and
    degenerating cells, and the early appearance of wall ingrowths in both
    generations. Other notable cytological features are highly pleomorphic
    plastids and mitochondrial aggregates in the gametophytic placental cells.
    Close similarities with the gametophyte-sporophyte junctions in Tmesipteris
    and major differences from those of homosporous lycophytes are in line with
    the placement of psilophytes and ferns in the same clade and distance both
    from lycophytes. A smooth interface between the two generations in Azolla
    suggests a clear-cut discontinuity between homosporous and heterosporous
    ferns, although this is the only heterosporous fern investigated to date.
    Similarities between the gametophyte-sporophyte junctions of
    leptosporangiate ferns and hornworts, when balanced against differences
    between them, are considered more likely the result of parallel evolution
    rather than homology.

    Uttara Kannada district in Central Western Ghats has the unique distinction
    of having the highest forest cover in the country. Ecological research
    spanning over three decades reveal the presence of about 67 species of ferns
    and fern-allies. The highest number of pteridophytes species is found in
    Joida taluk (41 species) followed by Siddapur (30 species), Karwar (25
    species) and Kumta (15 species). The semi-evergreen to evergreen forests of
    Castle rock, Kaiga and Yana and the primeval evergreen forests of Gerusoppa
    Ghats are the rich pteridophytes diversity locations in the district. Yana
    located in the foothills of central Western Ghats known for unusual
    cathedral like towering rock formations is a place of pilgrimage. Forest
    ecosystems are humid and evergreen and rich in endemic species of flora,
    especially pteridophytes, which were hitherto unexplored. Field
    investigations during October-November 2012 in the region led to the
    documentation of 21 species of ferns. This emphasizes the need for detailed
    pteridological investigations in the valleys and gorges of central Western
    Ghats. Fern species of Yana region belong to 17 genera and 15 families and
    the noteworthy species are – Cyathea gigantea, very rare to be found in
    Uttara Kannada and are indicators of undisturbed forests. Bolbitis
    subcrenatoides and B. semicordata (endemic to south India) and others like
    Blechnum orientale, Adiantum philippense, Stenochlaena palustris, Pteris
    pellucida and Dicranopteris linearis were notable in the fern community. The
    ever increasing anthropogenic pressure in the district, particularly
    targeting wet and shaded valleys for cultivation, is a big threat to the
    fragile ecosystems with the sensitive pteridophytes.

  abstract: >-
    Comparative analyses to test for a relationship between spore size and
    genome size show that they are not correlated. The data do however provide
    evidence for marked genome size variation between species in this group.
    These results indicate that Asplenium monanthes has undergone a two-fold
    expansion in genome size. Conclusions Our findings challenge the widely held
    assumption that spore size can be used to infer ploidy levels within
    apomictic fern complexes. We argue that the observed genome size variation
    is likely to have arisen via increases in both chromosome number due to
    polyploidy and chromosome size due to amplification of repetitive DNA (e.g.
    transposable elements, especially retrotransposons). However, to date the
    latter has not been considered to be an important process of genome
    evolution within homosporous ferns. We infer that genome evolution, at least
    in some homosporous fern lineages, is a more dynamic process than existing
    studies would suggest.

    achieved with half-strength MS salts and sucrose, agar, i-inositol and
    thiamine.HCl at 7500, 4000, 100 and 0.4 mg/L, respectively. The methods
    developed were satisfactory for a cross section of clones. Morphogenesis in
    vitro was dependent on medium osmotic potential.

    Species complexes consisting of ill-defined "species" are widely known among
    ferns, and their involvement with reticulate evolution is expected.
    Nevertheless approaches to reticulation history with DNA markers are not yet
    commonly adopted. We have successfully elucidated the biological status of
    the Vandenboschia radicans complex in East Asian islands by combining
    analyses of ploidy level, a cpDNA marker (rbcL), and a nuclear DNA marker
    (GapCp). The results based on 266 individuals collected from 174 localities
    throughout Japan and Taiwan suggest that complicated hybridizations have
    occurred involving at least three parental diploid species from within the
    V. radicans complex and Vandenboschia liukiuensis, which was formerly
    considered to be distinct from this complex. Triploids are the most common
    cytotype, but they show no evidence of apogamous reproduction, while all
    nonhybrid diploids are rare and have very limited distribution. Possible
    accounts of this phenomenon will be briefly discussed including the
    possibility of relict distribution and occasional apogamous reproduction.

    Acystopteris taiwaniana, formerly known only from Taiwan, is newly recorded
    in Japan (northern and central Honshu and Shikoku). Chromosome counts and
    DNA sequences (plastid rbcL and nuclear PgiC) suggested that it is an
    allotetraploid species originating from hybridization between diploid A.
    japonica and an unknown diploid species. Acystopteris taiwaniana differs
    from A. japonica in having glandular hairs on the indusia of the sori, paler
    stipes and rachises, wider angles of divergence of pinnae from the rachis
    and larger spores, although there overlaps in the variation. Triploid
    sterile hybrids between the two species occur occasionally at the periphery
    of populations of one of the parental species in Japan.

    PREMISE OF THE STUDY:Equisetum is the sole living representative of
    Sphenopsida, a clade with impressive species richness, a long fossil history
    dating back to the Devonian, and obscure relationships with other living
    pteridophytes. Based on molecular data, the crown group age of Equisetum is
    mid-Paleogene, although fossils with possible crown synapomorphies appear in
    the Triassic. The most widely circulated hypothesis states that the lineage
    of Equisetum derives from calamitaceans, but no comprehensive phylogenetic
    studies support the claim. Using a combined approach, we provide a
    comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Equisetales, with special emphasis on
    the origin of genus Equisetum.


    METHODS:We performed parsimony phylogenetic analyses to address
    relationships of 43 equisetalean species (15 extant, 28 extinct) using a
    combination of morphological and molecular characters.


    KEY RESULTS:We recovered Equisetaceae + Neocalamites as sister to
    Calamitaceae + a clade of Angaran and Gondwanan horsetails, with the four
    groups forming a clade that is sister to Archaeocalamitaceae. The estimated
    age for the Equisetum crown group is mid-Mesozoic.


    CONCLUSIONS:Modern horsetails are not nested within calamitaceans; instead,
    both groups have explored independent evolutionary trajectories since the
    Carboniferous. Diverse fossil taxon sampling helps to shed light on the
    position and relationships of equisetalean lineages, of which only a tiny
    remnant is present within the extant flora. Understanding these
    relationships and early character configurations of ancient plant clades as
    Equisetales provide useful tests of hypotheses about overall phylogenetic
    relationships of euphyllophytes and foundations for future tests of
    molecular dates with paleontological data.

    We compile and analyze data on the population genetic structure of
    broad-sense clonal plant populations where sexual recruitment is rare or
    absent. The data from 27 studies show a common theme: multiclonal
    populations of intermediate diversity and evenness tend to be the rule, most
    clones are restricted to one or a few populations, and widespread clones are
    exceptional. While a few studies have demonstrated that ecological
    differences among sympatric clones do occur, more experimental and
    theoretical studies are necessary to determine the role of selection and
    other evolutionary forces in maintaining clonal polymorphism.

    Here we focus on the “skinneri clade” of cheilanthoid ferns (Pteridaceae),
    revising its taxonomy based on a new set of molecular, cytogenetic, and
    morphological analyses. Though previously assigned to disparate genera, the
    five taxa formally recognized in this clade form a strongly supported
    monophyletic group when analyzed with both plastid (rbcL, atpA, trnG-R) and
    nuclear (gapCp) datasets. This novel lineage is recognized here as Ynesmexia
    gen. nov. in honor of Ynés Mexía, a pioneering Mexican-American botanist.
    Our molecular analyses indicate that Ynesmexia comprises two monophyletic
    groups, referred to here as the “subcordata” and “seemannii” subclades. The
    “subcordata” subclade encompasses plants previously treated as Cheilanthes
    skinneri, ×Hemionanthes gryphus and Hemionitis subcordata. Our data indicate
    that the first taxon comprises two species: a diploid treated here as
    Ynesmexia fournieri (comb. nov.) and a tetraploid corresponding to Y.
    skinneri (comb. nov.) s.str. Amplifying the differences in ploidy, these two
    taxa are distinguished by several aspects of sporophyte morphology,
    non-overlapping spore sizes, and allopatric geographic distributions. Our
    analyses also highlight the role of hybridization and polyploidy in the
    evolution of the group, indicating that: (1) Y. ×gryphus (comb. nov.) is a
    largely fertile homoploid hybrid between Y. subcordata (comb. nov.) and Y.
    fournieri, and (2) Y. skinneri s.str. is an allotetraploid between members
    of the “subcordata” and “seemannii” subclades. Although the latter subclade
    is morphologically (and likely cytogenetically) diverse, current data are
    insufficient to propose formal subdivision of the only recognized species,
    Y. seemannii (comb. nov.). The findings presented here challenge earlier
    taxonomic frameworks and offer new insights into the evolutionary history of
    this xeric-adapted fern lineage, underscoring the importance of using
    multi-faceted approaches to resolve complex taxonomic issues in plant
    biology.

    The generic classification of the Thelypteridaceae has been the subject of
    much controversy. Proposed taxonomic systems have varied from recognizing
    the approximately 1200 species in the family within the single genus
    Thelypteris, to systems favoring upwards of 30 genera. Insights on
    intrafamilial relationships, especially for neotropical taxa, have been
    gained from recent phylogenetic studies; however, in the most recent
    classification, 10 of 30 recognized genera are either non-monophyletic or
    untested. We sequenced 407 nuclear loci for 621 …

  abstract: >-
    Pteridophytes of the far-western Himalaya, from Kashmir to Pakistan, are
    listed, along with those from Iran, the most easterly part of the European
    type flora, following many years of study of the area. Phytogeographical
    aspects are discussed, emphasising the desertic gap barrier between the
    Sino-Himalayan and European-Mediterranean floras. The classification adopted
    and its partly indirect relationship to molecular-cladonomic schemes is
    explained and an outline of the author's previous work on the area is given.
    Due to dwindling rainfall and phytogeographical considerations, numbers of
    taxa (species and additional subspecies) drop dramatically going westwards,
    state-by-state, as follows: Jammu & Kashmir (India) - 184, Pakistan - 157,
    Afghanistan - 54; mainly European type flora : Iran - 61.

    The Pteridophytic flora of parts of the east Indo-Himalaya in
    Sikkim-Darjeeling and the Khasi Hills has long been well known in detail,
    with an unbroken line of collectors to modern times, and similarly in the
    west Himalaya, up to the modern day. Many species are known from both the
    West and East IndoHimalaya, while many others are known from the East, but
    do not reach the West. However for a Century and more, even up to the
    present day, what happens in between, in Nepal and how far west the E.
    Himalayan species extend there has been largely unknown to Indian botanists.
    The fern flora of Nepal has long been a mysterious blank on the
    phytogeographical map and despite the early, major efforts of Hamilton,
    Gardner, Don and Wallich, far less collection and study have happened there.
    In large part this was due to the fate of the long hidden work of Hamilton,
    Gardner and David Don, the writer of Prodromus Floræ Nepalensis (1824) and
    also to Wallich's lack of precise and sometimes seriously muddled
    localities. Don's fern types, though long safely preserved in boxes in store
    in the BM (Natural History Museum), London, were unincorporated until
    shortly after the Second World War, and were unknown to nearly all
    pteridologists until now. Nepal's pteridophytes then remained unknown due to
    the virtual closure of Nepal, from shortly after 1816 up until 1949.

    © 2018 Botanical Society of America Premise of the Study: Inferring the
    evolution of characters in Isoëtes has been problematic, as these plants are
    morphologically conservative and yet highly variable and homoplasious within
    that conserved base morphology. However, molecular phylogenies have given us
    a valuable tool for testing hypotheses of character evolution within the
    genus, such as the hypothesis of ongoing morphological reductions. Methods:
    We examined the reduction in lobe number on the underground trunk, or corm,
    by combining the most recent molecular phylogeny with morphological
    descriptions gathered from the literature and observations of living
    specimens. Ancestral character states were inferred using nonstationary
    evolutionary models, reversible-jump MCMC, and Bayesian model averaging. Key
    Results: Our results support the hypothesis of a directional reduction in
    lobe number in Isoëtes, with the best-supported model of character evolution
    being one of irreversible reduction. Furthermore, the most probable
    ancestral corm lobe number of extant Isoëtes is three, and a reduction to
    two lobes has occurred at least six times. Conclusions: From our results, we
    can infer that corm lobation, like many other traits in Isoëtes, shows a
    degree of homoplasy, and yet also shows ongoing evolutionary reduction.

    Methods: We used a combination of population genetic and multilocus
    molecular phylogenetic approaches to infer the relationships among the three
    described species in this clade and to determine the degree of isolation
    among the sampled populations.

    Results: We discovered that the populations studied are highly structured
    and that two of the species, as currently circumscribed, are not
    monophyletic. Instead, our phylogenetic results suggest that there are at
    least eight distinct “species‐level” clades within the PLC. Of these eight,
    ﬁve appear to have been the result of a rapid radiation.

    Conclusions: Our results suggest that the existing taxonomy does not reﬂect
    the actual diversity in the PLC and warrants further investigation.

    Summary Plants of Cystopteris fragilis from 9 different populations along an
    altitudinal gradient and from two additional populations were investigated.
    In three populations at 1410 m, 1630 m and 1830 m a.s.l., respectively,
    climatic conditions were recorded. The phenology of the plants, the sizes
    and dimensions of leaves and fitness parameters such as leaves per plant and
    fertility were studied. Leaf sizes and leaf number per plant were negatively
    correlated with altitude. However, the duration of development from snow
    melt and onset of the leaves till ripening was similar at different
    altitudes. Additionally, isozyme investigations and chromosome counts of a
    set of randomly sampled plants were performed. The genetic differentiation
    between populations suggests a relatively low gene flow. A significant
    positive correlation between number of enzyme phenotypes and altitude was
    recorded. Two different cytotypes were distinguished, a hexaploid and a
    pentaploid one.

  abstract: >-
    Herein, we report the presence of a plant paleocommunity, dominated by ferns
    of the family Osmundaceae, structurally preserved from the only known
    Mesozoic, fossiliferous geothermal deposits, from the La Matilde Formation
    (Middle-Upper Jurassic) in the Deseado Massif of Southern Patagonia,
    Argentina. A total of 13 siliceous chert blocks sampled in an area of
    approximately 250 m2, preserving a monotypic assemblage dominated by
    Osmundaceae embedded within its original swampy substrate, are documented.
    Additional Osmundaceae and fewer ferns and conifers are present in the
    stratigraphically continuous, adjacent chert levels. This association is
    comparable to those dominated by Osmundaceae in modern swampy settings, such
    as in high-altitude lagoons in the Paraná Forest in Northeastern Argentina.
    In addition, a diverse community of mutualistic, parasitic, and saprotrophic
    microorganisms associated with the ferns and conifers in the assemblage is
    present. These compositional, paleoenvironmental, and trophic
    characteristics of the Jurassic Osmundaceae suggest a possible case of
    ecological stasis, where Osmundaceae-dominated plant communities apparently
    persisted in swamps of comparable structures, functions, and physical
    characteristics for over 150 million years. This suggests that Osmundaceae
    formed similar communities in compatible settings in the Jurassic, becoming
    preserved in analogous configurations.

    Symbiotically associated cyanobacteria from Azolla mexicana and Azolla
    pinnata were isolated and cultured in a free-living state. Morphological
    analyses revealed differences between the free-living isolates and their
    symbiotic counterparts, as did restriction fragment length polymorphism
    (RFLP) analyses with both single-copy glnA and rbcS gene probes and a
    multicopy psbA gene probe. RFLP analyses with Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120
    nifD excision element probes, including an xisA gene probe, detected
    homologous sequences in DNA extracted from the free-living isolates.
    Sequences homologous to these probes were not detected in DNA from the
    symbiotically associated cyanobacteria. These analyses indicated that the
    isolates were not identical to the major cyanobacterial symbiont species
    residing in leaf cavities of Azolla spp. Nevertheless, striking similarities
    between several free-living isolates were observed. In every instance, the
    isolate from A. pinnata displayed banding patterns virtually identical to
    those of free-living cultures previously isolated from Azolla caroliniana
    and Azolla filiculoides. These results suggest the ubiquitous presence of a
    culturable minor cyanobacterial symbiont in at least three species of
    Azolla.

    The present paper concerns the phytochemistry & ethnomedicinal value of
    Drynaria quercifolia (L.) J. Sm., an epiphytic pteridophyte. This is an
    important ethno-medicinal plant containing the alkaloids and other chemical
    groups. The extraction of alkaloids from D. quercifolia was done by the cold
    maceration method in solvent ethanol. Reducing sugar, tannin, proline,
    saponin and phenols were estimated quantitatively also. The decoction
    prepared from plant parts is used in typhoid fever and is also used as
    anthelmintic, pectoral, expectorant, tonic, dyspepsia and astringent.

    Abstract
                The World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) is a comprehensive list of scientifically described plant species, compiled over four decades, from peer-reviewed literature, authoritative scientific databases, herbaria and observations, then reviewed by experts. It is a vital tool to facilitate plant diversity research, conservation and effective management, including sustainable use and equitable sharing of benefits. To maximise utility, such lists should be accessible, explicitly evidence-based, transparent, expert-reviewed, and regularly updated, incorporating new evidence and emerging scientific consensus. WCVP largely meets these criteria, being continuously updated and freely available online. Users can browse, search, or download a user-defined subset of accepted species with corresponding synonyms and bibliographic details, or a date-stamped full dataset. To facilitate appropriate data reuse by individual researchers and global initiatives including Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Catalogue of Life and World Flora Online, we document data collation and review processes, the underlying data structure, and the international data standards and technical validation that ensure data quality and integrity. We also address the questions most frequently received from users.

    The holotype of Aspidium ameristoneuron, the correct application of which
    has long been in doubt, has been identified in the herbarium RB in Rio de
    Janeiro. It was found to have been mislabeled, and its true origin is
    Mexico, not Cuba as stated in the protologue. The history of the labeling
    error is reconstructed, and the identity of Aspidium ameristoneuron with the
    species so far known as Ctenitis salvinii (here renamed Ctenitis
    ameristoneuros comb. nov.) is demonstrated. The names and synonyms involved
    are typified.

    Recent studies examining the evolutionary relationships of species assigned
    to Cheilanthes (Pteridaceae) reveal that the genus is highly polyphyletic.
    To achieve a monophyletic generic classification of the 400+ taxa of
    cheilanthoid ferns, it is necessary to transfer species that are only
    distantly related to the type species (Cheilanthes micropteris) to other
    genera. One of these species is Cheilanthes villosa Davenp. ex Maxon, which
    needs to be reassigned to the genus Myriopteris. Because the epithet villosa
    is preoccupied in Myriopteris and there are no synonyms for this distinctive
    taxon, a new name is required. The species is herein renamed Myriopteris
    windhamii.

    © 2016 The Author(s). Background: Transcriptomics in non-model plant systems
    has recently reached a point where the examination of nuclear genome-wide
    patterns in understudied groups is an achievable reality. This progress is
    especially notable in evolutionary studies of ferns, for which molecular
    resources to date have been derived primarily from the plastid genome. Here,
    we utilize transcriptome data in the first genome-wide comparative study of
    molecular evolutionary rate in ferns. We focus on the ecologically diverse
    family Pteridaceae, which comprises about 10 % of fern diversity and
    includes the enigmatic vittarioid ferns-an epiphytic, tropical lineage known
    for dramatically reduced morphologies and radically elongated phylogenetic
    branch lengths. Using expressed sequence data for 2091 loci, we perform
    pairwise comparisons of molecular evolutionary rate among 12 species
    spanning the three largest clades in the family and ask whether previously
    documented heterogeneity in plastid substitution rates is reflected in their
    nuclear genomes. We then inquire whether variation in evolutionary rate is
    being shaped by genes belonging to specific functional categories and test
    for differential patterns of selection. Results: We find significant,
    genome-wide differences in evolutionary rate for vittarioid ferns relative
    to all other lineages within the Pteridaceae, but we recover few significant
    correlations between faster/slower vittarioid loci and known functional gene
    categories. We demonstrate that the faster rates characteristic of the
    vittarioid ferns are likely not driven by positive selection, nor are they
    unique to any particular type of nucleotide substitution. Conclusions: Our
    results reinforce recently reviewed mechanisms hypothesized to shape
    molecular evolutionary rates in vittarioid ferns and provide novel insight
    into substitution rate variation both within and among fern nuclear genomes.

    PREMISE:Xeric environments impose major constraints on the fern life cycle,
    yet many lineages overcome these limitations by evolving apomixis. Here, we
    synthesize studies of apomixis in ferns and present an evidence-based model
    for the evolution and establishment of this reproductive strategy, focusing
    on genetic and environmental factors associated with its two defining
    traits: the production of "unreduced" spores (n = 2n) and the initiation of
    sporophytes from gametophyte tissue (i.e., diplospory and apogamy,
    respectively).


    METHODS:We evaluated existing literature in light of the hypothesis that
    abiotic characteristics of desert environments (e.g., extreme diurnal
    temperature fluctuations, high light intensity, and water limitation) drive
    the evolution of obligate apomixis. Pellaeid ferns (Cheilanthoideae:
    Pteridaceae) were examined in detail, as an illustrative example. We
    reconstructed a plastid (rbcL, trnG-trnR, atpA) phylogeny for the clade and
    mapped reproductive mode (sexual versus apomictic) and ploidy across the
    resulting tree.


    RESULTS:Our six-stage model for the evolution of obligate apomixis in ferns
    emphasizes the role played by drought and associated abiotic conditions in
    the establishment of this reproductive approach. Furthermore, our updated
    phylogeny of pellaeid ferns reveals repeated origins of obligate apomixis
    and shows an increase in the frequency of apomixis, and rarity of sexual
    reproduction, among taxa inhabiting increasingly dry North American deserts.


    CONCLUSIONS:Our findings reinforce aspects of other evolutionary,
    physiological, developmental, and omics-based studies, indicating a strong
    association between abiotic factors and the establishment of obligate
    apomixis in ferns. Water limitation, in particular, appears critical to
    establishment of this reproductive mode.

    Equisetum is a genus of 15 extant species that are the sole surviving
    representatives of the class Sphenopsida. The generally accepted taxonomy of
    Equisetum recognizes two subgenera: Equisetum and Hippochaete. Two recent
    phylogenetical studies have independently questioned the monophyly of
    subgenus Equisetum. Here, I use original (atpB) and published (rbcL,
    trnL-trnF, rps4) sequence data to investigate the phylogeny of the genus.
    Analyses of atpB sequences give an unusual topology, with E. bogotense
    branching within Hippochaete. A Bayesian analysis based on all available
    sequences yields a tree with increased resolution, favoring the sister
    relationships of E. bogotense with subgenus Hippochaete.

    Matteuccia struthiopteris
                (L.) Tod. – Ostrich fern (Onocleaceae) is the circumboreal species widely distributed in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. In the paper, we presented the results of the observations on the developing population of
                M. struthiopteris
                on the man-made lawn situated in the University Grove of Tomsk State University (Tomsk, Russian Federation). In the original making of the lawn, the ground was replaced by new rich soil, which was taken in early summer of 2007 from a native site situated 6.65 km towards south-west from Tomsk University. The formation of the plant community on the new lawn occurred mostly naturally, and sporophytes of this fern appeared naturally. The first sporophytes on the new lawn were detected in 2009, occurring initially in the significant numbers, recorded here. During the time of observation (2009–2018) the number of sporophytes decreased from an original 263 to 96, i.e. 63.5% of sporophytes died. The initial population in 2009 included only juvenile sporophytes. No spore-bearing sporophytes appear during the period of observation. For detection of the source of spores, from which the population on the lawn was formed, we selected three populations having fertile sporophytes, and conducted a molecular-genetic analysis. Two of the analyzed source populations were found to be situated at 160–365 m distance from the developing population and one population occurs near the place where the soil for new lawn making was taken. We used the ISSR method for analyzing the genetic diversity of populations and processed the results by software STRUCTURE Version 2.3.4. The result show, that new population, and population from the soil taking point belong to the same group. The coefficient of Nei’s genetic identity between these populations is high (I = 0.931). This confirms the origin of the new population from spores contained in the soil used for the lawn construction.

    Introgressive hybridization is an important evolutionary process frequently
    contributing to diversification and speciation of angiosperms. Its extent in
    other groups of land plants has only rarely been studied, however. We
    therefore examined the levels of introgression in the genus Diphasiastrum, a
    taxonomically challenging group of Lycopodiophytes, using flow cytometry and
    numerical and geometric morphometric analyses. Patterns of morphological and
    cytological variation were evaluated in an extensive dataset of 561
    individuals from 57 populations of six taxa from Central Europe, the region
    with the largest known taxonomic complexity. In addition, genome size values
    of 63 individuals from Northern Europe were acquired for comparative
    purposes. Within Central European populations, we detected a continuous
    pattern in both morphological variation and genome size (strongly correlated
    together) suggesting extensive levels of interspecific gene flow within this
    region, including several large hybrid swarm populations. The secondary
    character of habitats of Central European hybrid swarm populations suggests
    that man-made landscape changes might have enhanced unnatural contact of
    species, resulting in extensive hybridization within this area. On the
    contrary, a distinct pattern of genome size variation among individuals from
    other parts of Europe indicates that pure populations prevail outside
    Central Europe. All in all, introgressive hybridization among Diphasiastrum
    species in Central Europe represents a unique case of extensive
    interspecific gene flow among spore producing vascular plants that cause
    serious complications of taxa delimitation.

    Background and Aims:Polyploidy has played an important role in the evolution
    of ferns. However, the dearth of data on cytotype diversity, cytotype
    distribution patterns and ecology in ferns is striking in comparison with
    angiosperms and prevents an assessment of whether cytotype coexistence and
    its mechanisms show similar patterns in both plant groups. Here, an attempt
    to fill this gap was made using the ploidy-variable and widely distributed
    Cystopteris fragilis complex.Methods:Flow cytometry was used to assess DNA
    ploidy level and monoploid genome size (Cx value) of 5518 C. fragilis
    individuals from 449 populations collected over most of the species&apos;
    global distributional range, supplemented with data from 405 individuals
    representing other related species from the complex. Ecological preferences
    of C. fragilis tetraploids and hexaploids were compared using field-recorded
    parameters and database-extracted climate data.Key Results:Altogether, five
    different ploidy levels (2x, 4x, 5x, 6x, 8x) were detected and three species
    exhibited intraspecific ploidy-level variation: C. fragilis, C. alpina and
    C. diaphana. Two predominant C. fragilis cytotypes, tetraploids and
    hexaploids, co-occur over most of Europe in a diffuse, mosaic-like pattern.
    Within this contact zone, 40 % of populations were mixed-ploidy and most
    also contained pentaploid hybrids. Environmental conditions had only a
    limited effect on the distribution of cytotypes. Differences were found in
    the Cx value of tetraploids and hexaploids: between-cytotype divergence was
    higher in uniform-ploidy than in mixed-ploidy populations.Conclusions:High
    ploidy-level diversity and widespread cytotype coexistence in the C.
    fragilis complex match the well-documented patterns in some angiosperms.
    While ploidy coexistence in C. fragilis is not driven by environmental
    factors, it could be facilitated by the perennial life-form of the species,
    its reproductive modes and efficient wind dispersal of spores. Independent
    origins of hexaploids and/or inter-ploidy gene flow may be expected in
    mixed-ploidy populations according to Cx value comparisons.

    Pteriodophytes have a longer evolutionary history than any other vascular
    land plant and, therefore, have endured greater loss of phylogenetically
    informative information. This factor has resulted in substantial
    disagreements in evaluating characters and, thus, controversy in
    establishing a stable classification. To compare competing classifications,
    we obtained DNA sequences of a chloroplast gene. The sequence of 1206 nt of
    the large subunit of the ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase gene (rbcL) was
    determined from 58 species, representing almost all families of
    leptosporangiate ferns. Phlogenetic trees were inferred by the
    neighbor-joining and the parsimony methods. The two methods produced almost
    identical phylogenetic trees that provided insights concerning major general
    evolutionary trends in the leptosporangiate ferns. Interesting findings were
    as follows: (i) two morphologically distinct heterosporous water ferns,
    Marsilea and Salvinia, are sister genera; (ii) the tree ferns (Cyatheaceae,
    Dicksoniaceae, and Metaxyaceae) are monophyletic; and (iii) polypodioids are
    distantly related to the gleichenioids in spite of the similarity of their
    exindusiate soral morphology and are close to the higher indusiate ferns. In
    addition, the affinities of several "problematic genera" were assessed.

    We analyzed nucleotide variation in rbcL (the gene encoding the large
    subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) from 99 genera
    of leptosporangiate ferns representing 31 of the 33 extant families.
    Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using three meth ods: neighbor
    joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood. All three methods
    resulted in optimal trees that were similar. Within the context of those
    taxa examined, these trees suggest that: 1) Polypodiaceae, Grammitidaceae
    and Pleurosoriopsis form a monophyletic group that is most derived among
    indusiate ferns; 2) Davallia is closely related to the Polypodiaceae; 3)
    Tectoria is related to Oleandraceae rather than to other members of
    Dryopteridaceae; 4) Rumohra and Elaphoglossum are closely related; 5)
    Dryopteridaceae are polyphyletic; 6) a monophyletic group consists of
    Polypodiaceae, Grammitidaceae, Davalliaceae, Oleandraceae, Nephrolepidaceae,
    Lomariopsidaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Thelypteridaceae, Blechnaceae,
    Aspleniaceae, and Pleurosoriopsis; 7) Dennstaedtiaceae, Monachosoraceae,
    Pteridaceae, Vittariaceae, and the previous clade form a monophyletic group;
    8) Dennstaedtiaceae are polyphyletic; 9) tree ferns in the Cyatheaceae,
    Metaxyaceae, and Dicksoniaceae form a monophyletic group that emerged early
    in the diversification of leptosporangiate ferns; 10) Plagiogyriaceae and
    Loxomataceae emerge with the tree ferns; 11) heterosporous water ferns form
    a monophyletic group that diverged prior to the tree ferns; 12)
    Schizaeaceae, Cheiropleuriaceae, Dipteridaceae, Gleicheniaceae, Matoniaceae,
    and Hymenophyllaceae are basal to the heterosporous aquatic ferns; and 13)
    Osmundaceae are the most basal lineage of the leptosporangiate ferns.

    It has been demonstrated that antheridiogens determine gametangial
    initiation in cultures of some homosporous fern gametophytes. Studies of
    natural populations have implicated these compounds as breeding system
    controllers. In Cystopteris, response to antheridiogen varied significantly
    among species. While Cystopteris protrusa responded to exogenous
    antheridiogen, C. bulbifera did not. The allopolyploid derivative of these
    two species, C. tennesseensis, had an intermediate level of response. This
    marked physiological difference among morphologically similar taxa is
    valuable in delineating species and suggests a mechanism that may be
    associated with interspecific hybridization.

    Homosporous ferns have usually been considered highly polyploid because they
    have high chromosome numbers (average = 57.05). In angiosperms, species with
    chromosome numbers higher than = 14 generally have more isozymes than those
    with lower numbers, consistent with their polyploidy. By extrapolation,
    homosporous ferns would be expected to have many isozymes. However, ongoing
    surveys indicate that within fern genera, species having the lowest
    chromosome numbers have the number of isozymes considered typical of diploid
    seed plants. Only species above these lowest numbers have additional
    isozymes. Therefore, homosporous ferns either have gone through repeated
    cycles of polyploidy and gene silencing or were initiated with relatively
    high chromosome numbers. The latter possibility represents a radical
    departure from currently advocated hypotheses of fern evolution and suggests
    that there may be fundamental differences between the genomes of homosporous
    ferns and those of higher plants. These hypotheses can be tested by genetic,
    karyological, and molecular techniques.

    The allotetraploid Cystopteris tennesseensis and its putative diploid
    progenitors, C. bulbifera and C. protrusa, constitute the C. tennesseensis
    complex. Although previous studies provided evidence of morphological,
    ecological, and chromosomal differences among the members of this complex,
    puzzling morphological variability precluded consistent identification and
    treatment of the taxa. The current study combined morphometric analyses with
    surveys of chromosomal, isozymic, and gametophytic features and supported
    past treatments of the complex as three separate species. The diploids
    shared no allozymes for the nine enzymes examined, and meiotic analyses of
    triploid hybrids with C. tennesseensis provided additional evidence that the
    diploid genomes are nonhomologous. Because C. tennesseensis has a relatively
    narrow range and contains isozymic profiles that are consistently additive
    of diploid patterns, we suggest that this allopolyploid is a relatively
    young species. Isozymic variation in the tetraploid parallels that observed
    in the diploids, implying that genetic variability was introduced through
    recurrent hybridization. Analyses of isozymic data and gametophytic features
    indicated that the diploids outcross frequently and thus may form hybrids
    readily when sympatric with the tetraploid. In part because of these
    characteristics, precise identification of species and hybrids in this
    complex is difficult and depends on evaluation of cryptic features.

    Analysis of chloroplast DNA restriction site data was applied to members of
    the taxonomically troublesome Polypodium vulgare complex. In this group,
    chromosomal and isozyme analyses had clarified reticulate patterns of
    speciation, but had failed to generate robust hypotheses of diploid
    phylogeny. DNA's of five diploid and five tetraploid species, plus two
    outgroup species, were digested with 11 endonucleases and hybridized to fern
    chloroplast DNA probes, yielding 60 informative site changes. Restriction
    site mapping revealed that the general size and structure of the chloroplast
    genome in Polypodiumspecies corresponds closely to those of other ferns. The
    mean sequence divergence among diploid Polypodium species (0.017) was high
    compared to results for congeneric species of seed plants. Using P.
    plesiosorum and Pleopeltis angusta as outgroups, the monophyly of the P.
    vulgare complex was supported by at least 17 synapomorphies. Within the
    complex, two distinct diploid species groups (P. glycyrrhiza+ P.
    californicumand P. amorphum+ P. appalachianum+ P. sibiricum)were separated
    by a minimum of 28 restriction site mutations. Molecular data also revealed
    multiple and, in three cases, reciprocal origins of the tetraploids.

    fromthe plastid gene rbcL.Analysis of eight diploid species produceda single
    most parsimonioustree with three distinct clades. The lanceolatumclade (one
    species) was sisterto all otherspecies. The lunariaclade (two species) was
    sister to the simplex-campestreclade (five species) which contained two
    weakly supported subclades. Single populations of B. lunaria and B. simplex
    were more closely related to other species in the same geographicregion than
    to populations of their own species from distant geographic regions. In a
    second analysis that included both diploid and polyploid species, eight of
    twelve polyploid taxa had rbcLsequences identical to those of known
    diploids, which suggested relatively recent origins for these eight
    polyploid species. Four polyploids, B. ascendens, B. paradoxum, B.
    Xwatertonense,and B. minganense, did not associate with a diploid species,
    and thereforerepresentedpolyploid derivatives of diploid taxa that were not
    sampled and possibly are extinct. Associations of diploid and polyploid
    species as determined by rbcL analysis are consistent with
    morphologicalhypotheses of polyploid originswith the exception of B.
    ascendens, which did not possess the rbcLsequence of either of its putative
    diploid progenitors.

    Although the phylogeny of the ﬁlmy fern family (Hymenophyllaceae) is rapidly
    coming into focus, much remains to be uncovered concerning the evolutionary
    history of this clade. In this study, we use two data sets (108-taxon rbcL þ
    rps4, 204-taxon rbcL) and fossil constraints to examine the diversiﬁcation
    of ﬁlmy ferns and the evolution of their ecology within a temporal context.
    Our penalized likelihood analyses (with both data sets) indicate that the
    initial divergences within the Hymenophyllaceae (resulting in extant
    lineages) and those within one of the two major clades (trichomanoids)
    occurred in the early to middle Mesozoic. There was a considerable delay in
    the crown group diversiﬁcation of the other major clade (hymenophylloids),
    which began to diversify only in the Cretaceous. Maximum likelihood and
    Bayesian character state reconstructions across the broadly sampled
    single-gene (rbcL) phylogeny do not allow us to unequivocally infer the
    ancestral habit for the family or for its two major clades. However, adding
    a second gene (rps4) with a more restricted taxon sampling results in a
    hypothesis in which ﬁlmy ferns were ancestrally terrestrial, with epiphytism
    having evolved several times independently during the Cretaceous.

    Genome size is known to correlate with a number of traits in angiosperms,
    but less is known about the phenotypic correlates of genome size in ferns.
    We explored genome size variation in relation to a suite of morphological
    and ecological traits in ferns. Thirty-six fern taxa were collected from
    wild populations in Ontario, Canada. 2C DNA content was measured using flow
    cytometry. We tested for genome downsizing following polyploidy using a
    phylogenetic comparative analysis to explore the correlation between 1Cx DNA
    content and ploidy. There was no compelling evidence for the occurrence of
    widespread genome downsizing during the evolution of Ontario ferns. The
    relationship between genome size and 11 morphological and ecological traits
    was explored using a phylogenetic principal component regression analysis.
    Genome size was found to be significantly associated with cell size, spore
    size, spore type, and habitat type. These results are timely as past and
    recent studies have found conflicting support for the association between
    ploidy/genome size and spore size in fern polyploid complexes; this study
    represents the first comparative analysis of the trend across a broad
    taxonomic group of ferns.

  abstract: >-
    Adiantum alan-smithii (Pteridaceae) is described from Chiapas, Mexico. It is
    similar to A. raddianum, and previously identified as such, however it can
    be distinguished by its yellow-farinose indusia, the proximal acroscopic
    pinnule of each pinna usually overlapping the main rachis, flabellate
    segments, and rachises that are weakly flexuose distally. In contrast, A.
    raddianum has non-farinose indusia, the proximal pinnule of each pinna does
    not overlap the main rachis, and segments are obovate to rhomboid. The new
    species is described, illustrated, and a key to species of the A. raddianum
    group in Mexico is provided. This contribution adds an additional endemic
    species of Adiantum to the flora of Mexico, and is part of our ongoing
    effort to improve the circumscription of A. raddianum, one of the most
    over-applied names in the Neotropical fern flora.

    With more than 200 species, the maidenhair fern genus Adiantum is among the

    Many of its members, including numerous cultivars derived from A. raddianum,

    Summary
                Genomics has revolutionised the study of invasive species, allowing evolutionary biologists to dissect mechanisms of invasion in unprecedented detail. Botanical research has played an important role in these advances, driving much of what we currently know about key determinants of invasion success (e.g. hybridisation, whole‐genome duplication). Despite this, a comprehensive review of plant invasion genomics has been lacking. Here, we aim to address this gap, highlighting recent discoveries that have helped progress the field. For example, by leveraging genomics in natural and experimental populations, botanical research has confirmed the importance of large‐effect standing variation during adaptation in invasive species. Further, genomic investigations of plants are increasingly revealing that large structural variants, as well as genetic changes induced by whole‐genome duplication such as genomic redundancy or the breakdown of dosage‐sensitive reproductive barriers, can play an important role during adaptive evolution of invaders. However, numerous questions remain, including when chromosomal inversions might help or hinder invasions, whether adaptive gene reuse is common during invasions, and whether epigenetically induced mutations can underpin the adaptive evolution of plasticity in invasive populations. We conclude by highlighting these and other outstanding questions that genomic studies of invasive plants are poised to help answer.

    Comparative ontogenetic studies were made of the gametophyte generation
    grown from spores  taken from natural populations of the four species of
    Sadleria. Significant differences were  found between species in the nature
    of the perispore, presence or absence of a terminal  trichome on the
    onedimensional filament, and the sequence of gametangia formation. Breeding 
    tests were also conducted and sporophytes screened for recessive lethals.
    Three species were  found to have intergametophytic maring systems and
    heterozygosity for sporophytic lethals. Of  these, S. cycrtheoides and S.
    souleyetiana have retained the capability for monogametophytic 
    reproduction, whereas S. pallida has not. The fourth species, S. squarrosa,
    has a prolonged  gametophyte generation intolerant of higher light
    intensities. Correlations between frequency in  nature, habitat diversity,
    ability to colonize newly formed lava flows, reproductive biology and 
    syndromes of the gametophyte generation are made.

    Trophopods are modified stipe bases that function as starch-storage organs
    in a wide variety of mainly temperate ferns. Ever since they were first
    observed, the presence of trophopods has been explained by reference to
    seasonality and they have been assumed to provide nutrition for the rapidly
    expanding fern leaves in spring. We present the results of an analysis of
    the annual variation in starch content in Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.)
    Todaro, cultivated in the Leiden botanical garden. Our results show a
    distinct seasonal variation in starch content, suggesting that the presence
    of trophopods is indeed functionally linked to seasonality, but we do not
    find a decrease in starch content corresponding to the period of leaf
    expansion that would clearly link the depletion of stored starch to the
    expansion of new leaves.

    The Onocleaceae family, a small group within the Pteridophytes, comprises
    four genera, but has been phytochemically studied mainly for Pentarhizidium
    orientale, Pentarhizidium intermedium, and Matteuccia struthiopteris. To
    date, a total of 91 compounds have been isolated from these three species,
    including 15 flavonoids, 48 flavonoid glycosides, 6 stilbenes, 4
    isocoumarins, 2 phthalides, 3 chromones, 2 lignan glycosides, 8 isoprenoid
    derivatives, and 3 phenolic compounds. Notably, most flavonoids and
    flavonoid glycosides possess C-methyl groups at the C-6 and/or C-8
    positions, with several conjugated to (S)-3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)
    moieties. Although not all isolates have been evaluated for their
    pharmacological activities, several compounds have demonstrated
    bioactivities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, α-glucosidase
    inhibitory, aldose reductase inhibitory, and antioxidant effects.

    Alien aquatic plant species cause serious ecological and economic impacts to
    European freshwater ecosystems. This study presents a comprehensive overview
    of all alien aquatic plants in Europe, their places of origin and their
    distribution within the 46 European countries. In total, 96 aquatic species
    from 30 families have been reported as aliens from at least one European
    country. Most alien aquatic plants are native to Northern America, followed
    by Asia and Southern America. Elodea canadensis is the most widespread alien
    aquatic plant in Europe, reported from 41 European countries. Azolla
    ﬁliculoides ranks second (25), followed by Vallisneria spiralis (22) and
    Elodea nuttallii (20). The highest number of alien aquatic plant species has
    been found in Italy and France (34 species), followed by Germany (27),
    Belgium and Hungary (both 26) and the Netherlands (24). Even though the
    number of alien aquatic plants seems relatively small, the European and
    Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO, http://www.eppo.org) has
    listed 18 of these species as invasive or potentially invasive within the
    EPPO region. As ornamental trade has been regarded as the major pathway for
    the introduction of alien aquatic plants, trading bans seem to be the most
    eﬀective option to reduce the risk of further unintended entry of alien
    aquatic plants into Europe.

    IMPERATOF., 1991. Polyphenolics of phylogenetic and biosynthetic interest
    from the fern Cystopteris fragilis. Can. J. Bot. 69: 218-221. Four xanthones
    (mangiferin, isomangiferin, their aglycone 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone,and
    3-0-methylisomangiferin) have been isolated from the fern
    Cystopterisfragilis Bernh. The cooccurrence of the first three of these
    compounds suggests that C-glycosylation is the last step in the biosynthesis
    of C-glycosylxanthones. 3-0-Methylisomangiferin has previously been reported
    only from Mangijera indica, an angiosperm. In addition to the above
    substances, a C-glycosylflavonoid (6,8di-C-glucosylapigenin, also known as
    vincenin-2) and two sulphate esters of 1-caffeylglucose (I-caffeylglucose
    6-sulphate and I-caffeylglucose 3-sulphate) have been isolated from C.
    fragilis.

    Cystopteris is a small genus of c. 20+ species closely allied to Athyrium.
    Within the genus, the C. fragilis (L.) Bernh. aggregate consists of a number
    of related and critical species and/or subspecies with small lanceolate,
    bipinnate-tripinnatifid fronds. Thus far only C. fragilis is known from
    Iraq, but a collection of this group we have made from near Malakan, Erbil
    District, N.E. Iraq, has turned out to be C. diaphana (Bory) Blasdell,
    alternatively C. fragilis subsp. diaphana (Bory) Litard., newly discovered
    in Iraq. This species is distinguished from C. fragilis in having densely
    short-spiny spores with crowded, rather blunt-apexed spines and in having
    most or nearly all the laminar vein-endings being in small notches or
    sometimes small flat areas, as opposed to longer, acute and less crowded
    spines and veins terminating at the tips of the teeth at the
    segment-margins. C. diaphana is scattered through Macaronesia, Atlantic and
    Mediterranean Europe, N.E. Turkey, Georgia, Iran, Pakistan, N.W. India, W.
    Nepal and Russia (Altai); also in Yemen and across Africa to the Mascarene
    Islands, and in C. and S. America. Iraq is thus a linking area towards
    Arabia and East Africa. We have studied and described the collection
    herewith.

                  Salvinia
                  are recorded from the Paleocene and Eocene of Montana and the Dakotas. Three new species of
                  Azolla
                  are described and two species of
                  Azolla
                  are redescribed. The columella of the floating apparatus of the megaspore apparatuses of
                  Azolla
                  appears to be a phylogenetic localization of the perispore around the megaspore. A new section of
                  Azolla
                  (section
                  Kremastospora)
                  is created for species whose megaspore apparatuses have many floats and whose massulae have hooked (anchor‐shaped) glochidia.
                  Salvinia preauriculata
                  is based only on leaf remains from the Eocene of North America. Megaspores and massulae which probably are conspecific with the leaf remains are described. The megaspores and massulae of the fossil species are much smaller than those of the living species,
                  S. auriculata
                  , with which
                  S. preauriculata
                  has been compared. The similar size of the megaspores and massulae of the fossil species suggests a less specialized condition than in living species, where these two structures differ greatly in size.
                  Azollopsis tomentosa
                  , previously known from the late Cretaceous, has been found in the Eocene.

  abstract: >-
    More than 80&#37; of Madagascar&#39;s 12,000 plant species are endemic with
    the degree of endemism reaching as much as 95&#37; in the scaly tree ferns,
    an important species rich component of Madagascar&#39;s evergreen
    rainforests. Predominantly African or Asian ancestry and divergence times
    usually postdating the separation of Madagascar from the Gondwanan
    landmasses have been demonstrated for several Madagascan animal and
    angiosperm groups. However, evolutionary studies of rainforest-specific
    lineages are scarce and the ecological context of radiation events has
    rarely been investigated. Here, we examine the evolution of Madagascan tree
    ferns as a rainforest-specific model family, integrate results from
    bioclimatic niche analysis with a dated phylogenetic framework, and propose
    an evolutionary scenario casting new light on our knowledge of the evolution
    of large island endemic clades. We show that Madagascar&#39;s extant tree
    fern diversity springs from three distinct ancestors independently
    colonizing Madagascar in the Miocene and that these three monophyletic
    clades diversified in three coincident radiation bursts during the Pliocene,
    reaching exceptionally high diversification rates and most likely responding
    to a common climatic trigger. Recent diversification bursts may thus have
    played a major role in the evolution of the extant Madagascan rainforest
    biome, which hence contains a significant number of young, neoendemic taxa.

  abstract: >-
    The vast abundance of terpene natural products in nature is due to enzymes
    known as terpene synthases (TPSs) that convert acyclic prenyl diphosphate
    precursors into a multitude of cyclic and acyclic carbon skeletons. Yet the
    evolution of TPSs is not well understood at higher levels of classification.
    Microbial TPSs from bacteria and fungi are only distantly related to typical
    plant TPSs, whereas genes similar to microbial TPS genes have been recently
    identified in the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii. The goal of this
    study was to investigate the distribution, evolution, and biochemical
    functions of microbial terpene synthase-like (MTPSL) genes in other plants.
    By analyzing the transcriptomes of 1,103 plant species ranging from green
    algae to flowering plants, putative MTPSL genes were identified
    predominantly from nonseed plants, including liverworts, mosses, hornworts,
    lycophytes, and monilophytes. Directed searching for MTPSL genes in the
    sequenced genomes of a wide range of seed plants confirmed their general
    absence in this group. Among themselves, MTPSL proteins from nonseed plants
    form four major groups, with two of these more closely related to bacterial
    TPSs and the other two to fungal TPSs. Two of the four groups contain a
    canonical aspartate-rich "DDxxD" motif. The third group has a "DDxxxD"
    motif, and the fourth group has only the first two "DD" conserved in this
    motif. Upon heterologous expression, representative members from each of the
    four groups displayed diverse catalytic functions as monoterpene and
    sesquiterpene synthases, suggesting these are important for terpene
    formation in nonseed plants.

    Angiopteris weimingii, a morphologically distinct new species of Angiopteris
    (Marattiaceae) from southern Yunnan, China, is described. Compared with A.
    itoi, the new species can be distinguished by a taller habit (1.2–2.5 m vs.
    0.5–1.5 m), a greater number of pinnae pairs (8–13 pairs vs. 4–9 pairs), a
    caudate tip (1 cm vs. 2–4 cm), the position of sori from the leaf margin (2
    mm vs. 3–5 mm), spore color (yellow vs. white), and spore ornamentation
    (densely verrucate vs. clavate-echinate). Molecular phylogenetic analyses
    confirm its affinity with the Archangiopteris clade. With a single known
    population of approximately 30 adults and severe habitat destruction, the
    species is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR) under IUCN criteria.

    Premise of the study: Not all ferns grow in moist, shaded habitats; some
    lineages thrive in exposed, seasonally dry environments. Notholaenids are a
    clade of xeric-adapted ferns commonly characterized by the presence of a
    waxy exudate, called farina, on the undersides of their leaves. Although
    some other lineages of cheilanthoid ferns also have farinose sporophytes,
    previous studies suggested that notholaenids are unique in also producing
    farina on their gametophytes. For this reason, consistent farina expression
    across life cycle phases has been proposed as a potential synapomorphy for
    the genus Notholaena. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown two species
    with nonfarinose sporophytes to be nested within Notholaena, with a third
    nonfarinose species well supported as sister to all other notholaenids. This
    finding raises the question: are the gametophytes of these three species
    farinose like those of their close relatives, or are they glabrous,
    consistent with their sporophytes? Methods: We sowed spores of a diversity
    of cheilanthoid ferns onto culture media to observe and document whether
    their gametophytes produced farina. To place these species within a
    phylogenetic context, we extracted genomic DNA, then amplify ed and
    sequenced three plastid loci. The aligned data were analyzed using maximum
    likelihood to generate a phylogenetic tree. Key results: Here we show that
    notholaenids lacking sporophytic farina also lack farina in the gametophytic
    phase, and notholaenids with sporophytic farina always display gametophytic
    farina (with a single exception). Outgroup taxa never displayed gametophytic
    farina, regardless of whether they displayed farina on their sporophytes.
    Conclusions: Notholaenids are unique among ferns in consistently expressing
    farina across both phases of the life cycle. © 2012 Botanical Society of
    America.

    © 2019 Elsevier Inc. Notholaenids are an unusual group of ferns that have
    adapted to, and diversified within, the deserts of Mexico and the
    southwestern United States. With approximately 40 species, this group is
    noted for being desiccation-tolerant and having “farina”—powdery exudates of
    lipophilic flavonoid aglycones—that occur on both the gametophytic and
    sporophytic phases of their life cycle. The most recent circumscription of
    notholaenids based on plastid markers surprisingly suggests that several
    morphological characters, including the expression of farina, are
    homoplasious. In a striking case of convergence, Notholaena standleyi
    appears to be distantly related to core Notholaena, with several taxa not
    before associated with Notholaena nested between them. Such conflicts can be
    due to morphological homoplasy resulting from adaptive convergence or,
    alternatively, the plastid phylogeny itself might be misleading, diverging
    from the true species tree due to incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization,
    or other factors. In this study, we present a species phylogeny for
    notholaenid ferns, using four low-copy nuclear loci and concatenated data
    from three plastid loci. A total of 61 individuals (49 notholaenids and 12
    outgroup taxa) were sampled, including 31 out of 37 recognized notholaenid
    species. The homeologous/allelic nuclear sequences were retrieved using
    PacBio sequencing and the PURC bioinformatics pipeline. Each dataset was
    first analyzed individually using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference,
    and the species phylogeny was inferred using *BEAST. Although we observed
    several incongruences between the nuclear and plastid phylogenies, our
    principal results are broadly congruent with previous inferences based on
    plastid data. By mapping the presence of farina and their biochemical
    constitutions on our consensus phylogenetic tree, we confirmed that the
    characters are indeed homoplastic and have complex evolutionary histories.
    Hybridization among recognized species of the notholaenid clade appears to
    be relatively rare compared to that observed in other well-studied fern
    genera.

    Speciation via hybridization and polyploidization is a major evolutionary
    force in plant evolution but is still poorly understood for neopolyploid
    groups. Challenges are attributed to high heterozygosity, low genetic
    divergence, and missing information on progenitors, ploidy, and
    reproduction. We study the large Eurasian Ranunculus auricomus species
    complex and use a comprehensive workﬂow integrating reduced-representation
    sequencing (RRS) genomic data to unravel reticulate evolution, genome
    diversity and composition of polyploids.

    other and to the meniscioid reticulate one of Callipteris, with the result
    that D. heterophlebium, Diplaziopsis and Hemidctyum may constitute a small
    natural group within Diplazium, and the sagenioid venation of this group may
    have arisen from a free venation in parallel with the meniscioid venation of
    Callipteris.

    Matteuccia intermedia is .morphologically so roughly intermediate between M.
    struthiopteris and Onoclea orientalis that it has been suggested to be of
    hybrid origin between the latter two species. Matteuccia intermedia has
    prominent pneumatophores at the base of the stipe, an almost flat adaxial
    side of the stipe and rhachis, and the chromosome number 2n-80, and did not
    show a combination of enzyme bands either of which is the same as that of
    either of the formally presumed parental species for the 14 allozymes
    examined, among which were seven unique enzyme bands. These three features
    indicate that M. intermedia is not a hybrid nor a species of recent hybrid
    origin but a distinct species, obviously related to 0. orientalis. A
    nomenclatural combination to Onoclea is proposed - 0. intennedia (C.Chr.)

    all bivalents with c.84II and c.126II, while those of the pentaploid C.
    fragilis showed many univalents and bivalents that produced mostly sterile
    spores. The pentaploid C. fragilis was suggested to be a hybrid between the
    tetraploid and the hexaploid C. fragilis.

  abstract: >-
    Germinating spores were obtained from a pentaploid Cystopteris fragilis
    collected in Mongolian Altai. DNA content of nuclei in gametophytes showed
    for the first time that gametophytes that developed from spores of the
    pentaploid sporophyte had a larger number of genomes than those of the
    mother sporophyte, and some appeared to be decaploid. Fertile decaploid
    (10n) spores may be produced in the pentaploid C. fragilis and derived from
    monad spores observed in sporogenesis. Antheridia were produced on the 10n
    gametophytes, although antherozooids with swimming ability were not
    observed. Archegonia were not observed. Apogamous sporophytes with 10n
    genome content were induced from decaploid gametophytes. The monad spores
    produced may contribute to the formation of higher polyploid sporophyte
    series in ferns.

    Aquatic and wetland weeds pose serious threats to the freshwater resources
    of the United States. Essentially unregulated sale of plants for aquarium
    and ornamental pool use has resulted in the recent introduction and spread
    of several highly invasive weeds, including giant salvinia. This problem has
    been exacerbated during the past few years by mail-order and e-commerce. The
    objective of this study was to examine mail order and the internet as
    sources for sale of invasive aquatic weeds, with primary emphasis on the
    Internet. An online search was conducted using the search engine Yahoo™.
    Data were collected on twelve of the most common and highly invasive weeds
    sold by the industry. The data from the ﬁrst 100 hits were grouped into
    regulatory, educational, commercial, hobbyist, and foreign sites.
    Essentially every aquatic or wetland plant listed in the United States as
    either a Federal Noxious Weed or as a noxious weed in one or more states was
    found. Twelve highly invasive plants intentionally sold by the wetland
    nurseries and water garden dealerships were found listed for sale by sites
    throughout the United States and internationally. This study shows that
    stronger enforcement of laws and regulations and an intensive education and
    outreach effort are needed to prevent further introductions of invasive
    weeds through the aquatic and wetland plant industry.

    While the family Schizaeaceae (Schizaeales) represents only about 0.4% of
    the extant fern species diversity, it differs from other ferns greatly in
    gross morphologies, niche preferences, and life histories. One of the most
    notable features in this family is its mycoheterotrophic life style in the
    gametophytic stage, which appears to be associated with extensive losses of
    plastid genes. However, the limited number of sequenced plastomes, and the
    lack of a wellresolved phylogenetic framework of Schizaeaceae, makes it
    difficult to gain any further insight. Here, with a comprehensive sampling
    of ~77% of the species diversity of this family, we first inferred a plastid
    phylogeny of Schizaeaceae using three DNA regions. To resolve the deep
    relationships within this family, we then reconstructed a plastome-based
    phylogeny focusing on a selection of representatives that covered all the
    major clades. From this phylogenomic backbone, we traced the evolutionary
    histories of plastid genes and examined whether gene losses were associated
    with the evolution of gametophytic mycoheterotrophy. Our results reveal that
    extant Schizaeaceae is comprised of four major clades—Microschizaea,
    Actinostachys, Schizaea, and Schizaea pusilla. The loss of all plastid
    NADH-like dehydrogenase (ndh) genes was confirmed to have occurred in the
    ancestor of extant Schizaeaceae, which coincides with the evolution of
    mycoheterotrophy in this family. For chlorophyll biosynthesis genes (chl),
    the losses were interpreted as convergent in Schizaeaceae, and found not
    only in Actinostachys, a clade producing achlorophyllous gametophytes, but
    also in S. pusilla with chlorophyllous gametophytes. In addition, we
    discovered a previously undescribed but phylogenetically distinct species
    hidden in the Schizaea dichotoma complex and provided a taxonomic treatment
    and morphological diagnostics for this new species—Schizaea medusa. Finally,
    our phylogenetic results suggest that the current PPG I circumscription of
    Schizaea is non-monophyletic, and we therefore proposed a three-genus
    classification moving a subset of Schizaea species sensu PPG I to a third
    genus—Microschizaea.

    The origin and early evolution of land plants in the mid-Palaeozoic era,
    between about 480 and 360 million years ago, wasan important event in the
    history of life, with far-reaching consequences for the evolution of
    terrestrial organisms and global environments. A recent surge of interest,
    catalysed by palaeobotanical discoveries and advances in the systematics of
    living plants, provides a revised perspective on the evolution of early land
    plants and suggests new directions for future research.

    Here we describe 18 new species of the Marattialean genus Danaea: D. alba,
    D. ampla, D. antioquiana, D. elongata, D. kessleri and D. panamensis (all in
    D. subg. Danaea); D. dilatata and D. opaca (in D. subg. Arthrodanaea); and
    D. andina, D. cuspidopsis, D. erosa, D. nasua, D. peruviana, D. polypinna,
    D. pumila, D. robbinmoranii, D. ubatubensis, and D. velona (in D. subg.
    Holodanaea). We provide illustrations, maps of geographical distribution,
    and nomenclatural notes for the new species. We also lectotypify the name D.
    media and propose that its recent resurrection was a mistake: both D. media
    and D. elata are synonyms of D. nodosa, which is widespread in Central
    America and the Greater Antilles; we find that D. pterorachis is a valid
    name applicable to the Costa Rican material that has been referred to D.
    media. We consider D. sellowiana and D. nigrescens as distinct species and
    these names applicable to D. subg. Danaea material from the Brazilian
    Atlantic Forest and Amazonia, respectively, and we also lectotypify the name
    D. nigrescens here. We accept D. cuspidata and D. betancurii as species
    distinct from D. moritziana. Evolutionary relationships and an
    identification key for the 79 species we currently recognize in Danaea are
    published in a parallel paper (Keskiniva & al. 2024).

    We have produced a near-complete phylogeny for the neotropical fern genus
    Danaea (Marattiaceae). The phylogeny is based on four loci of the
    chloroplast DNA and shows reconstructions of the evolutionary relationships
    between 68 of the currently recognized 81 taxa of Danaea. A parallel paper
    (Keskiniva & Tuomisto 2024) draws on this phylogeny to describe 18 new
    species; here we discuss the phylogeny and its taxonomical implications more
    broadly. We propose three new synonyms: D. atlantica Christenh. & al. (= D.
    geniculata), D. draco Christenh. (= D. polymorpha), and D. moralesiana A.
    Rojas (= D. erecta). On the other hand, we consider D. jamaicensis Underw.,
    which has been synonymized before, to be a distinct species. In addition, we
    propose that D. ×ushana is a hybrid between D. simplicifolia and D.
    nigrescens. We also provide an open-access online key to the 81 taxa. The
    key is available at
    https://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v4/neo_fern_genus_danaea/.

    The number of hybrids has been reported to be lower in tropical than
    temperate ferns, but patterns of hybridization are poorly known in the
    tropics. We examine hybridization in the Neotropical fern genus Danaea
    (Marattiaceae) using a phylogenomic approach with single or low-copy nuclear
    and chloroplast loci and haplotype phasing. We find a high hybridization
    rate of 10%–18% for Danaea, similar to the rates observed for temperate
    ferns. We find further evidence for the previously proposed low reproductive
    barriers in ferns, enabling hybridization and even the production of
    hybridization-derived species between lineages separated possibly as far
    back as the Cretaceous. We found that Danaea trifoliata and D. wendlandii
    are fertile, hybridization-derived species between lineages diverged
    potentially 14–72 million years ago (mya) and 23–62 mya, respectively. We
    also confirm that the previously recognized species D. ×ushana is a likely
    sterile hybrid between D. simplicifolia (D. subg. Arthrodanaea) and D.
    nigrescens (D. subg. Danaea), which diverged potentially 27–83 mya. We find
    that hybridization may function as a homogenizing force in Danaea, as the
    subgenus with the highest signals for hybridization (D. subg. Arthrodanaea)
    also has the fewest species that are the least morphologically and
    genetically diverged. We describe a new hybrid between D. wendlandii (D.
    subg. Holodanaea) and D. subg. Danaea as D. ×deltoidea.

    A herbarium sheet housed in CAL from Milam glacier, collected by Strachey
    and Winterbottom in 1848 was remained unidentified and overlooked for more
    than 150 years. Based on diagnostic denticulate segment margins it is
    identified by the present author as Hymenophyllum denticulatum, on the other
    hand the species of the Hymenophyllum reported from western part of Himalaya
    are entire margined. The sheet is also compared and analysed with other
    serrate and denticulate Indian species for diagnosis. Hymenophyllum
    denticulatum Sw. is primarily a S. E. Asian species reached up to Assam in
    north eastern India. Occurrence of this species in Kumaon region of
    Uttarakhand Himalaya seems to be significant phytogeographically therefore
    presented in this communication.

    In this study, the chloroplast (cp) genome sequences from three early
    diverged leptosporangiate ferns were completed and analyzed in order to
    understand the evolution of the genome of the fern lineages. The complete cp
    genome sequence of Osmunda cinnamomea (Osmundales) was 142,812 base pairs
    (bp). The cp genome structure was similar to that of eusporangiate ferns.
    The gene/intron losses that frequently occurred in the cp genome of
    leptosporangiate ferns were not found in the cp genome of O. cinnamomea. In
    addition, putative RNA editing sites in the cp genome were rare in O.
    cinnamomea, even though the sites were frequently predicted to be present in
    leptosporangiate ferns. The complete cp genome sequence of Diplopterygium
    glaucum (Gleicheniales) was 151,007 bp and has a 9.7 kb inversion between
    the trnL-CAA and trnVGCA genes when compared to O. cinnamomea. Several
    repeated sequences were detected around the inversion break points. The
    complete cp genome sequence of Lygodium japonicum (Schizaeales) was 157,142
    bp and a deletion of the rpoC1 intron was detected. This intron loss was
    shared by all of the studied species of the genus Lygodium. The GC contents
    and the effective numbers of codons (ENCs) in ferns varied significantly
    when compared to seed plants. The ENC values of the early diverged
    leptosporangiate ferns showed intermediate levels between eusporangiate and
    core leptosporangiate ferns. However, our phylogenetic tree based on all of
    the cp gene sequences clearly indicated that the cp genome similarity
    between O. cinnamomea (Osmundales) and eusporangiate ferns are
    symplesiomorphies, rather than synapomorphies Therefore, our data is in
    agreement with the view that Osmundales is a distinct early diverged lineage
    in the leptosporangiate ferns.

    Polyploidy occurs in the heterosporous and homosporous Pteridophyta, but
    with a much higher frequency in the latter. Ninety-six percent of the
    homosporous Pteridophyta show a gametic chromosome number greater than 27,
    whereas 90 percent of the heterosporous ones possess a gametic chromosome
    number less than 28. Ultrafrequent establishment of poly- ploidy in the
    homosporous Pteridophy- ta appears to be necessary to create and maintain
    genetic variation in the face of the homozygotizing effects of habitual
    self-fertilization in the monoe- cious gametophytes of these plants.

    A cladistic analysis based on rbcL gene sequences from a representative
    sample of 18 species yields three most parsimonious trees that strongly
    support monophyly of Selaginellaceae. Within Selaginellaceae, the
    morphologically distinctive subgenus Selaginella is resolved as sister group
    to a clade composed of all other species, here termed the rhizophoric clade.
    In the rhizophoric clade, subgenus Stachygynandrum is paraphyletic to
    subgenera Ericetorum, Tetragonostachys, and Heterostachys. Monophyly of
    Ericetorum and Tetragonostachys is strongly corroborated. Results support a
    close relationship between "resurrection plants" in Stachygynandrum and the
    mat-forming or tufted drought-tolerant species of Tetragonostachys,
    indicating a common origin of xerophytism in these groups. A close
    relationship for all isophyllous species, as hypothesized in many
    classifications, is not supported by the rbcL data. Leaf isophylly and
    reduction in Ericetorum and Tetragonostachys most probably represent
    independent reversals of the marked anisophyllous condition in
    Stachygynandrum. Leaf reduction is one of a suite of characters that may
    have evolved in response to seasonal drought.

    The phylogenetic position of Cystodium J. Sm. is studied here for the first
    time using DNA sequence data. Based on a broad sampling of leptosporangiate
    ferns and two plastid genes (rbcL and atpB), we show that Cystodium does not
    belong to the tree fern family Dicksoniaceae, as previously thought. Our
    results strongly support including Cystodium within the large polypod clade,
    and suggest its close relationship to the species-poor grade taxa at the
    base of the polypod topology (Sphenomeris and Lonchitis, or Saccoloma in
    this study). Further studies, with an expanded taxon sampling within
    polypods, are needed to fully understand the more precise phylogenetic
    relationships of Gystodium.

    Tree ferns are a well-established clade within leptosporangiate ferns. Most
    of the 600 species (in seven families and 13 genera) are arborescent, but
    considerable morphological variability exists, spanning the giant scaly tree
    ferns (Cyatheaceae), the low, erect plants (Plagiogyriaceae), and the
    diminutive endemics of the Guayana Highlands (Hymenophyllopsidaceae). In
    this study, we investigate phylogenetic relationships within tree ferns
    based on analyses of four protein-coding, plastid loci (atpA, atpB, rbeL,
    and rps4). Our results reveal four well-supported clades, with genera of
    Dicksoniaceae (sensu Kubitzki, 1990) interspersed among them: (A)
    (Loxomataceae, (Culcita, Plagiogyriaceae)), (B) (Calochlaena, (Dicksonia,
    Lophosoriaceae)), (C) Cibotium, and (D) Cyatheaceae, with
    Hymenophyllopsidaceae nested within. How these four groups are related to
    one other, to Thyrsopteris, or to Metaxyaceae is weakly supported. Our
    results show that Dicksoniaceae and Cyatheaceae, as currently recognised,
    are not monophyletic and new circumscriptions for these families are needed.

    Tree ferns recently were identified as the closest sister group to the
    hyperdiverse clade of ferns, the polypods. Although most of the 600 species
    of tree ferns are arborescent, the group encompasses a wide range of
    morphological variability, from diminutive members to the giant scaly tree
    ferns, Cyatheaceae. This well-known family comprises most of the tree fern
    diversity ([~]500 species) and is widespread in tropical, subtropical, and
    south temperate regions of the world. Here we investigate the phylogenetic
    relationships of scaly tree ferns based on DNA sequence data from five
    plastid regions (rbcL, rbcL-accD IGS, rbcL-atpB IGS, trnG-trnR, and
    trnL-trnF). A basal dichotomy resolves Sphaeropteris as sister to all other
    taxa and scale features support these two clades: Sphaeropteris has conform
    scales, whereas all other taxa have marginate scales. The marginate-scaled
    clade consists of a basal trichotomy, with the three groups here termed (1)
    Cyathea (including Cnemidaria, Hymenophyllopsis, Trichipteris), (2)
    Alsophila sensu stricto, and (3) Gymnosphaera (previously recognized as a
    section within Alsophila) + A. capensis. Scaly tree ferns display a wide
    range of indusial structures, and although indusium shape is homoplastic it
    does contain useful phylogenetic information that supports some of the
    larger clades recognised.

  abstract: >-
    Whereas the distribution of the principal pteri- dophyte families over the
    major parts of the globe is quite similar to that of the principal
    angiosperm families, pteri- dophyte genera are in general considerably more
    widespread. Four possible explanations are discussed: greater age of fern
    genera and thus a longer period available for dispersal; slower evolution of
    ferns; greater dispersability through small size of diaspores; and
    non-equivalence of fern and angiosperm gen- era. Furthermore, primitive fern
    genera diverge in their distribution patterns from those of primitive
    angiosperms; they tend to occupy special habitats and/or to possess special
    growth forms, rather than being concentrated in geographical relict areas,
    as are angiosperms. Finally, the 'American Para- dox' in the distribution of
    fern genera and sections, which is an imbalance between the Old and the New
    World, is briefly alluded to.

    Ferns and lycophytes of Taiwan display an extraordinarily high diversity.
    Despite the detailed species documentation, the pteridophyte flora of Taiwan
    as a whole has never been organized into a phylogenetic framework. Here we
    provide an updated, phylogeny-based checklist that includes a total of 824
    (infra)species taxa, of which eleven are first recorded. In addition,
    lectotypification of Phlegmariurus salvinioides and new combinations of 25
    taxa were made in this study. Our classification scheme is based on the most
    recent phylogenetic evidence, and for all taxon names accepted here, we
    provide their best corresponding names in Taiwanese Mandarin. Our appendix
    and the online file also supply other details, such as synonyms, for the
    Taiwanese pteridophytes in order to track their nomenclatural changes from
    the previous floristic documentations. Finally, a discussion group for our
    community-Taiwan Pteridophyte Group (TPG)- is established online. This
    platform will allow more users to follow further updates of TPG or to
    provide any comments on new versions of Taiwan pteridophyte checklist.

    Many organic hazardous pollutants, including phenol, which are toxic and not
    easily biodegradable, can concerns for environmental pollution worldwide.
    The aim of this study was to investigate the biosorption potential of Azolla
    towards phenol from aqueous solutions. The effects of temperature and phenol
    concentration on growth of azolla, temperature, phenol concentration,
    biomass concentration on phenol removal and evaporation rate of phenol were
    determined in batch experiment. The growth of azolla and phenol removal
    increased up to 95% at 30˚C, respectively and after this point both
    decreased. Removal efficiency of phenol and the growth rate of azolla
    reduced by increasing the initial concentration of phenol. The removal
    efficiency was more than 97% when phenol concentration was 5 ppm and amount
    of biomass was 0.9 gr. The plants such as Azolla are a big problem
    throughout the world and especially in Iran (the region of Anzali). This
    plant could be used as beneficial and low cost method to remove pollutants
    from effluents.

  abstract: >-
    Wild edible plants have become an attractive variation of the human diet,
    especially in East Asia, North America, and Oceania. However, their
    potential in nutrition is only rarely considered in Europe. This study aims
    to reveal the nutritional and antioxidant potential of mature fern leaves
    from 13 families grown in Europe. We found that most of the examined fern
    species displayed a high antioxidant capacity, exceeding 0.5 g Trolox
    equivalent per gram of extract dry weight in ORAC assay and reaching IC50
    values lower than 30 µg⋅mL 1 in DPPH assay (with the value for Trolox 7
    µg⋅mL 1). Most of the species also appeared to be a good source of
    carotenoids, especially of lutein (205 µg⋅g 1 DW on average) and β-carotene
    (161 µg⋅g 1 DW on average) when compared to the reference leafy vegetables
    spinach and rocket. A cytotoxicity test using ovine hepatocytes showed a
    non-toxicity effect of fern leaf extracts.

    Making an investigation of Cystopteris fragilis coll. in Greenland, I found
    that the two wellknown types: the Dickieana-type with verrucose spores, and
    C. fragilis with spiny spores were both represeted in Greenland. The former
    is shown to be a high Arctic species with wid distribution southwards (fig.
    1). THe latter, a sub Arctic species (Fig. 2). In Iceland and on the Faeroe
    Islands C. fragilis is very common, while the Dickieana-type only has been
    found from one locaity on Iceland. In the material from Greenland I have
    found a few plants with intermediate spore-type. Three of these were
    collected from the northeast coast, far beyond the northern limite of C.
    fragilis, they may for the present be regarded as a local type. In the
    transition area between C. fragilis and the Dickieana-type supposed hybrids
    were found

  abstract: >-
    Guided by systematic studies on Melpomene , we tested the monophyly of the
    genus by analyzing sequences of cpDNA ( atpb , rbcL ) and morphological
    characters for 24 of the 29 recognized species. The atpb data did not yield
    any resolution of the investigated group. The other data sets each supported
    the monophyly of the genus, as did all data combined, and indicate it to be
    sister to the Lellingeria apiculata group as proposed in previous studies.
    While the morphologically distinct M. leptostoma and M. gracilis are basal
    lineages with long branch lengths, most of the relationships within the core
    genus are weakly supported and have very short branch lengths. This
    indicates a recent radiation of the genus in the northern Andes, its center
    of diversity, apparently under the influence of the fast uplift of the
    mountain range and of glacial fluctuations of the vegetation zones, with
    subsequent dispersals to the Guyana Highlands, the Brazilian shield, and
    Africa.

    Molecular studies in the pantropical fern genus Lindsaea provided further
    support for the hypothesis that L. × heterophylla is a natural hybrid
    between L. ensifolia and L. orbiculata. Most interestingly, the cpDNA
    phylogeny indicates not only multiple origins for the hybrid species, but
    those hybridization events have been bidirectional, yet producing
    morphologically identical offspring. True extent of hybrid speciation within
    Lindsaea still remains unknown and the use of nrDNA sequence data is
    required for more complete understanding on the reticulate evolutionary
    patterns in the genus.

    Fern identification usually requires the use of mature sporophytes, since
    attempts to identify juveniles using morphological traits often provides
    unsatisfactory results. Here we examined young sporophytes found among
    boulders in a river basin of a xeric valley in central Peru. Attempts to
    identify these sporophytes first pointed to four different genera, two in
    Pteridaceae (Anogramma and Pityrogramma), and the others in Aspleniaceae
    (Asplenium) and Cystopteridaceae (Cystopteris). Here, we resolved this
    puzzle combining morphology and sequences of DNA (rbcL and trnG-R) that
    point to Pityrogramma trifoliata of Pteridaceae.

    Abstract
                The Legume Phylogeny Working Group’s Taxonomy Working Group was tasked to create a community endorsed global legume checklist that will serve as a primary source of taxa for biodiversity data platforms and legume-related research. The checklist was published in June 2021, recognising 772 genera and 22,360 species. It is disseminated through the new Legume Data Portal as part of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) hosted portal initiative. The process that was followed to publish and disseminate the checklist and its content is described here. The impact of the work by the Taxonomy Working Group are quantified by comparing the published checklist with the GBIF taxonomic backbone. A total of 44,157 names overlapped with the GBIF taxonomic backbone while 30,456 names were added, which enabled more accurate name matching of 61,235 legume occurrences. Continuous improvement to the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP): Fabaceae checklist will allow the GBIF taxonomic backbone and other checklist managers to converge to a consistent and comprehensive list of legume taxa globally over time.

    Two new species ofthe late Paleozoic fern Scolecopteris (Marattiales) are
    described and their relationships within the genus are discussed.
    Scolecopteris charma sp.n., from Steubenville, Ohio (Duquesne Coal, Upper
    Pennsylvanian), is similar to species in the Oliveri group, while S. gnoma
    sp.n, from Providence, Kentucky (Baker Coal, Middle Pennsylvanian), compares
    favorably with the Latifolia species group. Scolecopteris gnoma is most
    similar to S. fragilis but differs in its smaller synangia and spore type.
    S. charma appears generally similar to S. iowensis because of its large
    pedicel and histologically undifferentiated walls, but differs in a number
    of characters such as vasculature and spore type. Despite its occurrence
    late in the Pennsylvanian, S. charma is thought to possess a number of
    primitive character states (large trilete spores, vascularized pedicels,
    fiat pinnules with downtumed margins). Using the same criteria for the much
    older S. gnoma, we note a number of relatively apomorphic character states
    (small monolete spores, unvascularized pedicels, extended pinnule margins).
    An outgroup analysis of species-level characters of Scolecopteris gives a
    better concept of primitive versus derived traits in marattialean and other
    ferns. Genera in the Paleozoic fern orders Filicales (Ankyropteris) and
    Zygopteridales iCorynepteris, Musatea) were chosen as outgroups, and the
    comparisons support suggestions for the polarity ofseveral important
    characters. Some ofthese agree with previously proposed evolutionary
    polarities based on the geological occurrence of marattialean ferns.

    Phylogenetic positions of the enigmatic asiatic fern genera Diplaziopsis and

  type: article-journal
  volume: '101'

- id: li2011rbcl
  abstract: >-
    Background: DNA barcoding will revolutionize our understanding of fern
    ecology, most especially because the accurate identification of the
    independent but cryptic gametophyte phase of the fern's life history-an
    endeavor previously impossible-will finally be feasible. In this study, we
    assess the discriminatory power of the core plant DNA barcode (rbcL and
    matK), as well as alternatively proposed fern barcodes (trnH-psbA and
    trnL-F), across all major fern lineages. We also present plastid barcode
    data for two genera in the hyperdiverse polypod clade-Deparia (Woodsiaceae)
    and the Cheilanthes marginata group (currently being segregated as a new
    genus of Pteridaceae)-to further evaluate the resolving power of these loci.
    Principal Findings: Our results clearly demonstrate the value of matK data,
    previously unavailable in ferns because of difficulties in amplification due
    to a major rearrangement of the plastid genome. With its high sequence
    variation, matK complements rbcL to provide a two-locus barcode with strong
    resolving power. With sequence variation comparable to matK, trnL-F appears
    to be a suitable alternative barcode region in ferns, and perhaps should be
    added to the core barcode region if universal primer development for matK
    fails. In contrast, trnH-psbA shows dramatically reduced sequence variation
    for the majority of ferns. This is likely due to the translocation of this
    segment of the plastid genome into the inverted repeat regions, which are
    known to have a highly constrained substitution rate. Conclusions: Our study
    provides the first endorsement of the two-locus barcode (rbcL+matK) in
    ferns, and favors trnL-F over trnH-psbA as a potential back-up locus. Future
    work should focus on gathering more fern matK sequence data to facilitate
    universal primer development. © 2011 Li et al. This is an open-access

  abstract: >-
    Ferns are well known for their shade-dwelling habits. Their ability to
    thrive under low-light conditions has been linked to the evolution of a
    novel chimeric photoreceptor-neochrome-that fuses red-sensing phytochrome
    and blue-sensing phototropin modules into a single gene, thereby optimizing
    phototropic responses. Despite being implicated in facilitating the
    diversification of modern ferns, the origin of neochrome has remained a
    mystery. We present evidence for neochrome in hornworts (a bryophyte
    lineage) and demonstrate that ferns acquired neochrome from hornworts via
    horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Fern neochromes are nested within hornwort
    neochromes in our large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions of phototropin
    and phytochrome gene families. Divergence date estimates further support the
    HGT hypothesis, with fern and hornwort neochromes diverging 179 Mya, long
    after the split between the two plant lineages (at least 400 Mya). By
    analyzing the draft genome of the hornwort Anthoceros punctatus, we also
    discovered a previously unidentified phototropin gene that likely represents
    the ancestral lineage of the neochrome phototropin module. Thus, a neochrome
    originating in hornworts was transferred horizontally to ferns, where it may
    have played a significant role in the diversification of modern ferns.

    © 2016 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. We describe and
    illustrate a new species, Asplenium pifongia., currently known only from
    Taiwan. Although superficially similar to A. monanthe., this species is a
    sexual diploid and has little perforation on its spore surfaces.
    Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that A. pifongia. is not closely related
    to A. monanthe., and is instead sister to the A. normal. complex. Asplenium
    pifongia. differs from A. normal. in having sori mostly only on, and
    parallel to, the basiscopic side of pinnae, a common feature in A.
    monanthes.

    © 2018 The Author(s). Ferns are the closest sister group to all seed plants,
    yet little is known about their genomes other than that they are generally
    colossal. Here, we report on the genomes of Azolla filiculoides and Salvinia
    cucullata (Salviniales) and present evidence for episodic whole-genome
    duplication in ferns - one at the base of 'core leptosporangiates' and one
    specific to Azolla. One fern-specific gene that we identified, recently
    shown to confer high insect resistance, seems to have been derived from
    bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. Azolla coexists in a unique
    symbiosis with N2-fixing cyanobacteria, and we demonstrate a clear pattern
    of cospeciation between the two partners. Furthermore, the Azolla genome
    lacks genes that are common to arbuscular mycorrhizal and root nodule
    symbioses, and we identify several putative transporter genes specific to
    Azolla-cyanobacterial symbiosis. These genomic resources will help in
    exploring the biotechnological potential of Azolla and address fundamental
    questions in the evolution of plant life.

    Research Author(s): Chunxiang Li, Robbin C. Moran, Junye Ma, Bo Wang,
    Jiasheng Hao, Qun Yang Abstract An unusual tree fern trapped in
    mid-Cretaceous Myanmar amber is described as Thyrsopteris cretacea sp. nov.
    (Thyrsopteridaceae). The fossil most resembles T. elegans, a present-day
    species endemic to the Juan Fernández Islands, based on the character
    combination of pinnate fertile lamina segments with short lobes bearing
    terminal sori, cyathiform indusia, clavate receptacles, and oblique annuli.
    Thyrsopteris cretacea is the first described mid-Cretaceous tree fern
    preserved in amber. It adds to the diversity previously ascribed to the
    Thyrsopteridaceae, which has been based on Eocene fossils, and it extends
    the fossil record of the family further back to the mid-Cretaceous. Most
    previous fossils of Thyrsopteridaceae have been from the Southern Hemisphere
    and are therefore considered Gondwanan. Thyrsopteris cretacea represents one
    of the few occurrences of the family in Laurasia.

    A new fossil belonging to the Lindsaeaceae is described as Proodontosoria
    myanmarensis gen. et sp. nov. from the mid-Cretaceous Myanmar amber. Its
    classification in the extant Lindsaeaceae is based on laterally fused vein
    tips that bear sori, indusia opening toward the segment margins, and trilete
    spores. The number of annulus cells and the size of sporangium suggest that
    the fossil probably belongs to a stem group element of this family.

    In Indochina the species diversity of Cyatheaceae remains insufficiently
    known. Here we demonstrate the scaly tree fern Gymnosphaera salletii in
    Vietnam to be an assemblage of three distinct species based on molecular and
    morphological data, and report for the first time the occurrence of foliar
    nectaries in Gymnosphaera. The true G. salletii is morphologically unique
    based on the protuberant glands present on the petiole. Gymnosphaera
    phankelocii sp. nov. and Gymnosphaera vietnamensis sp. nov. are recognized
    as new species; G. phankelocii is characterized by its distant two-rowed
    sori and G. vietnamensis by the sub-tripinnate fronds. Our phylogenetic
    analyses indicated that G. phankelocii is a relatively isolated species,
    while G. vietnamensis is a member of the G. salletii clade along with G.
    austroyunnanensis, G. salletii, and G. saxicola. The two new species and
    members of the G. salletii clade are all local endemics, and provide good
    examples to understand the frequent local endemics and their evolution in
    scaly tree ferns. Eleven species of Gymnosphaera are now known from
    Indochina; we provide a diagnostic key to these species.

    Gleicheniaceae is an early diverging lineage of leptosporangiate ferns,
    characterized by pseudodichotomous frond branching. While six genera are
    phylogenetically supported, Sticherus has been found to be paraphyletic. To
    resolve this issue, we describe a new genus, Sticheroides gen. nov., to
    accommodate Sticherus truncatus and S. milnei, based on phylogenetic
    placement, time divergence depth, and frond architecture. We provide an
    updated identification key to the genera, descriptions, and comments.
    Sticheroides diverged from the clade formed by
    Gleichenia+Stromatopteris+Sticherus approximately 114–117 Mya and is
    distinguished by buds and rhizomes covered with scales and anisotomic
    branching. The new genus solves the paraphyly of Sticherus as defined so
    far, while ensuring nomenclatural stability within Gleicheniaceae.

The abundance of Marattialean taxa in the fossil record provides good opportunities to study the evolution and phylogeny within the group through time. In this paper, marattialean fossils from Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic are re-viewed and from this taxonomic occurrences discussed and evolutionary trends summarized. In addition, a preliminary cladistic analysis incorporating relevant data from both fossils and living\_…"

  abstract: >-
    Edible ferns are some of the most important wild vegetables in China. This
    paper reviews their food uses. The history of eating ferns in China may go
    back as far as 3000 years. An ethnobotanical inventory of edible ferns was
    created, with 52 species (including 4 varieties), which were traditionally
    used. The potential species number of edible ferns was estimated as 144
    species (including 4 varieties). The cuisines, products and chemical
    components of ferns were also summarized. The most commonly eaten fern,
    Pteridium aquilinum var. latiusculum, was discussed in terms of its
    toxicity, massive productivity and development strategies. Suggestions and
    recommendations were proposed for the future development of edible ferns in
    China.

    Considering the importance of the lesser known edible Pteridophytes the
    present study was carried out to assess the nutritive value, elemental
    analysis and antioxidant property of Christella dentata (Forssk.) Brownsey &
    Jermy and Lygodium flexuosum L. Moisture content, crude fat, crude fibre,
    vitamin C, protein, total carbohydrates and starch content were studied in
    tender fronds on dry weight basis. Nutritive value of Lygodium flexuosum was
    higher compared to Christella dentata. Elemental analysis revealed good
    amount of micro and macronutrient in both the ferns. Total phenolic content
    and antioxidant property of these edible ferns was studied using aqueous and
    ethanolic extracts. Total phenolic content of C. dentata aqueous extract and
    L. flexuosum ethanolic extract was found to be higher. DPPH scavenging
    activity was found higher in aqueous extract of C. dentata and ethanolic
    extract of L. flexuosum. Maximum reducing power was recorded in aqueous
    extract of C. dentata and ethanolic extract of L. flexuosum. Antioxidant
    properties of both the ferns were found directly proportional to their
    phenolic content.

  abstract: >-
    Marattialean ferns and medullosan seed ferns are two dominant groups in late
    Carboniferous lowland tropical ﬂoras. Differences in their foliage suggest
    that some seed ferns may have had a higher preservation potential when
    compared to marattialean ferns. Should this be accurate, it would suggest
    that when the two groups are found together, marattialean ferns would be
    better preserved and potentially better represented than seed ferns. Such
    taphonomic biases would have direct implications for evaluating plant
    diversity in deep time. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed more than
    880 fern and seed fern fossils encased in siderite (FeCO3) concretions from
    the ~ 308 Ma Mazon Creek Lagersta¨tte to test if seed fern foliage is better
    preserved than fern foliage with respect to taxonomic information. For
    comparative purposes, we conducted a series of decay experiments on two
    modern ferns and a cycad (the last providing a seed fern analogue) for 160
    days. Despite anatomical and compositional differences, fossil analyses
    demonstrate that ferns and seed ferns are equally well preserved in the
    Mazon Creek Lagersta¨tte with respect to venation, which represents one of
    the most important taxonomic characters of the ﬂora. The decay experiments
    support this conclusion: despite having a more robust leaf, cycad leaves
    decayed at a similar rate to the thinner, more hypothetically fragile ferns.
    Together, our results indicate that our ability to discriminate within and
    between ferns and seed ferns is not biased by differential preservation in
    the Mazon Creek ﬂora.

  abstract: >-
    The taxonomy of the cliff fern family Woodsiaceae has been controversial
    with 22–59 species in 1–7 genera recognized in various classifications. This
    is mainly due to limited taxon sampling (up to 33 accessions representing up
    to 21 species) and poor resolution in molecular studies so far. In the
    present study, DNA sequences of five plastid markers (atpA, matK, rbcL, rps4
    + rps4-trnS, trnL + trnL-F) of 152 accessions representing ca. 43 out of ca.
    65 species estimated of Woodsiaceae (122 accessions), and 30 nonWoodsiaceae
    accessions from the most closely related four families (Athyriaceae,
    Blechnaceae, Onocleaceae, Thelypteridaceae) were used to infer a phylogeny.
    Our major results include: (1) Woodsiaceae are strongly supported as
    monophyletic; (2) Two major clades representing the deepest split in
    Woodsiaceae are identified, corresponding to the two recently proposed
    subfamilies, Woodsioideae and Protowoodsioideae; (3) Within Woodsioideae and
    Protowoodsioideae, two and three well-supported subclades, respectively, are
    determined; (4) Cheilanthopsis is resolved as paraphyletic in relation to
    Hymenocystis (sampled for the first time) and Protowoodsia; (5) Physematium
    and Woodsiopsis are paraphyletic in relation to a clade containing
    Cheilanthopsis, Hymenocystis, and Protowoodsia; (6) Evolution of 13
    morphological characters is inferred in a phylogenetic context, and
    morphological synapomorphies of each of the five major subclades are
    identified; (7) We propose to recognize two genera in Woodsiaceae based on
    deep divergence (ca. 45 Ma), morphology, chromosome number, and geographic
    distribution: Physematium (syn.: Cheilanthopsis, Hymenocystis, Protowoodsia,
    Woodsiopsis) and Woodsia (syn.: Eriosoriopsis), and Physematium is further
    divided into three subgenera and Woodsia into two subgenera; (8) we describe
    ×Woodsimatium, a hybrid genus (nothogen. nov.) between the two genera
    recognized. A taxonomic synopsis of the family is provided, and 15 new
    combinations are made.

    A new species provisionally assigned to the extant genus Regnellidium Lindm.
    (Regnellidium upatoiensis sp. nov.) is established for isolated sporocarps
    assignable to the heterosporous water fern family Marsileaceae. Three
    sporocarps and hundreds of dispersed megaspores were recovered from
    unconsolidated clays and sifts of the Eutaw Formation (Santonian, Late
    Cretaceous) along Upatoi Creek, Georgia, U.S.A. The sporocarps are
    ellipsoidal and flattened, contain both megasporangia and microsporangia,
    and possess a two-layered wall-an outer sclerenchymatous layer and an inner
    parenchymatous layer. In situ megaspores are spheroidal, with two distinct
    wall layers-an exine, differentiated into two layers, and an outer
    ornamented perine also differentiated into two layers. The megaspores also
    possess an acrolamella consisting of six (five to seven) triangular lobes
    that are twisted. In situ microspores are trilete and spheroidal, with a
    strongly rugulate perine, and show modification of the perine over the
    laesura to form an acrolamella. Comparison of the fossil sporocarps with
    those of four extant species of Marsileaceae reveal marked similarity with
    Regnellidium diphyllum Lindm., particularly in megaspore and microspore
    morphology. If found dispersed, the in situ megaspores would be assigned to
    Molaspora lobata (Dijkstra) Hall and the microspores to Crybelosporites
    Dettmann based on their size, shape, and ornamentation. Regnellidium
    upatoiensis sp. nov. extends the stratigraphic range of the genus back to
    the Santonian, nearly contemporaneous with the first evidence of Marsilea,
    and implies that the diversification of the Marsileaceae into its extant
    lineages occurred in the mid-Cretaceous.

    Chromosome counts of ten species of Chinese Woodsiaceae are reported.
    Chromosome numbers and morphological comparison support the proposal that
    the family Woodsiaceae should be divided into three genera, and the genus
    Woodsia into five sections. Base numbers of x = 33 in Protowoodsia and x =
    41, 39 and 38 in Woodsia may indicate relationship with Sticherus (x = 34)
    and Dicranopteris(x= 43) in Gleicheniaceae. Woodsiaceae may be derived from
    the common ancestor of Sticherus and Dicranopteris.

    Lygodium microphyllum, ﬁrst naturalized in the 1960s, has aggressively
    invaded forest-dominated wetlands in southern and central Florida. The
    indeterminate growth of this invasive climbing fern creates thick rachis
    mats which climb over shrubs and trees smothering the underlying growth and
    carrying ground ﬁres into the forest canopy. Foreign surveys for natural
    enemies identiﬁed 20 species of insects and two species of mites. Host range
    testing of three insect species and one mite included ﬁve Lygodium species
    (L. palmatum, L. volubile, L. cubense, L. venustum, and L. oligostachyum)
    native to the United States and the West Indies. A molecular phylogeny of
    the genus was conducted using the trnL intron and the trnL-F intergenic
    spacer of chloroplast DNA to determine the relationship of L. microphyllum
    to other Lygodium species. Three major clades appeared, one with L. palmatum
    and L. articulatum (the most basal), a second with L. reticulatum and L.
    microphyllum, and a third comprising the other species examined. Lygodium
    microphyllum appeared at the end of a long branch approximately equidistant
    from all species of interest preventing the correlation of genetic distance
    and host range behavior. However, inspection of the results of host range
    experiments showed a relationship between the presence of a related biotype
    or species of the insect on a related alternate host and the ability of that
    insect to develop on that alternate host. Ancestral host usage and
    ecological ﬁtting are examined as possible explanations for the acceptance
    of L. palmatum by the tested musotimine insects. Published by Elsevier Inc.

    Herbaceous plants rely on a combination of turgor, ground tissues and
    geometry for mechanical support of leaves and stems. Unlike most angiosperms
    however, ferns employ a sub-dermal layer of fibers, known as a hypodermal
    sterome, for support of their leaves. The sterome is nearly ubiquitous in
    ferns, but nothing is known about its role in leaf biomechanics. The goal of
    this research was to characterize sterome attributes in ferns that
    experience a broad range of mechanical stresses, as imposed by their
    aquatic, xeric, epiphytic, and terrestrial niches. Members of the
    Pteridaceae meet this criteria well. The anatomical and functional
    morphometrics along with published values of tissue moduli were used to
    model petiole flexural rigidity and susceptibility to buckling in 20 species
    of the Pteridaceae. Strong allometric relationships were observed between
    sterome thickness and leaf size, with the sterome contributing over 97% to
    petiole flexural rigidity. Surprisingly, the small-statured cheilanthoid
    ferns allocated the highest fraction of their petiole to the sterome, while
    large leaves exploited aspects of geometry (second moment of area) to
    achieve bending resistance. This pattern also revealed an economy of
    function in which increasing sterome thickness was associated with
    decreasing fiber cell reinforcement, and fiber wall fraction. Lastly, strong
    petioles were associated with durable leaves, as approximated by specific
    leaf area. This study reveals meaningful patterns in fern leaf biomechanics
    that align with species leaf size, sterome attributes and life-history
    strategy.

    Invasive alien plants (IAPs) pose a threat to biodiversity and the economy
    of the countries they invade. In South Africa, the Department of
    Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Natural Resources Management
    Programmes, previously The Working for Water Programme (WfW) is tasked with
    controlling IAPs in a way that protects the environment, as well as
    producing maximum return to society through poverty alleviation. Biological
    control is one of the management tools used to control IAPs in South Africa.
    Four aquatic weeds, Pista stratiotes, Salvinia molesta, Azolla ﬁliculoides
    and Myriophyllum aquaticum, are under complete biological control in South
    Africa. However, in the absence of biological agents, the WfW programme
    would have used herbicides to control these weeds. This paper presents a
    retrospective analysis of the relative herbicide cost-saving associated with
    the use of biological control instead of chemical control. The study used
    cost beneﬁt analysis (CBA) framework with an 8% discount rate. The estimated
    cost of the biological control on all four aquatic weeds was about R7.8
    million, while the estimated cost of chemical control to achieve the same
    level of control varied between R150 million and R1 billion, depending on
    the method of application and number of follow up operations. Beneﬁt to cost
    ratios varied between 90:1 and 631:1, again depending on method of
    application and number of follow up sprays. The results remained robust
    under a 5% and 10% sensitivity test and show that biological control is the
    most costeﬀective management option for aquatic weeds in South Africa.

    The Paleocene megafossil flora of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains
    region in the United States of America, including leaves, cones, fruits, and
    seeds, monographed by Roland W. Brown in 1962, has been reevaluated and
    updated to include subsequent taxonomic revisions. The scope of this
    investigation included thousands of specimens from more than 450 localities
    of the Fort Union, Evanston, Ferris, Raton, Bear, Lebo, Melville, Ludlow,
    Tongue River and Sentinel Butte strata of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming,
    Montana and North and South Dakota. A large number of floristic elements
    remain uncertain as to their modern familial affinities due to limited
    diagnostic characters, or insufficient comparative investigations.
    Nevertheless, many of Brown’s determinations have been upheld and several
    newly recognized genera and families have strong support. The flora includes
    greater diversity of Platanaceae and Cornales than Brown had recognized.
    These, together with Fagales (particularly Betulaceae and Juglandaceae),
    Saxifragales (Trochodendroides, Archeampelos and Nyssidium), are widespread
    and prominent members of the flora. New combinations introduced here include
    Ensete goldianum (LESQUEREUX) comb. nov., Macginitiea nobilis (NEWBERRY)
    comb. nov., Platanites raynoldsii (NEWBERRY) comb. nov., Trochodendroides
    genetrix (NEWBERRY) comb nov., Cucurbitaciphyllum lobatum (KNOWLTON) comb.
    nov., and Mciveraephyllum nebrascense (SCHIMPER) comb. nov. Georeference
    data are provided for all of the localities cited by Brown.

    Ferns are notorious for possessing large genomes and numerous chromosomes.
    Despite decades of speculation, the processes underlying the expansive
    genomes of ferns are unclear, largely due to the absence of a sequenced
    homosporous fern genome. The lack of this crucial resource has not only
    hindered investigations of evolutionary processes responsible for the
    unusual genome characteristics of homosporous ferns, but also impeded
    synthesis of genome evolution across land plants. Here, we used the model
    fern species Ceratopteris richardii to address the processes (e.g.,
    polyploidy, spread of repeat elements) by which the large genomes and high
    chromosome numbers typical of homosporous ferns may have evolved and have
    been maintained. We directly compared repeat compositions in species
    spanning the green plant tree of life and a diversity of genome sizes, as
    well as both short- and long-read-based assemblies of Ceratopteris. We found
    evidence consistent with a single ancient polyploidy event in the
    evolutionary history of Ceratopteris based on both genomic and cytogenetic
    data, and on repeat proportions similar to those found in large flowering
    plant genomes. This study provides a major stepping-stone in the
    understanding of land plant evolutionary genomics by providing the first
    homosporous fern reference genome, as well as insights into the processes
    underlying the formation of these massive genomes.

    The large size and complexity of most fern genomes have hampered efforts to
    elucidate fundamental aspects of fern biology and land plant evolution
    through genome-enabled research. Here we present a chromosomal genome
    assembly and associated methylome, transcriptome and metabolome analyses for
    the model fern species Ceratopteris richardii . The assembly reveals a
    history of remarkably dynamic genome evolution including rapid changes in
    genome content and structure following the most recent whole-genome
    duplication approximately 60 million years ago. These changes include
    massive gene loss, rampant tandem duplications and multiple horizontal gene
    transfers from bacteria, contributing to the diversification of
    defence-related gene families. The insertion of transposable elements into
    introns has led to the large size of the Ceratopteris genome and to
    exceptionally long genes relative to other plants. Gene family analyses
    indicate that genes directing seed development were co-opted from those
    controlling the development of fern sporangia, providing insights into seed
    plant evolution. Our findings and annotated genome assembly extend the
    utility of Ceratopteris as a model for investigating and teaching plant
    biology.

    Four diploid plants and four tetraploid plants of Phegopteris
    decursive-pinnata  were investigated for determination of the reproductive
    characteristics of their  gametophytes and two major features were
    recognized. First, gametophytes of the  diploids showed an ontogenetic
    sequence of gametangium formation which is unfavorable  for
    intragametophytic selfing, whereas those of the tetraploids showed that
    favorable  for intragametophytic selfing. Second, 41 to 72~o of the isolated
    gametophytes of  the diploids produced sporophytes in the intragametophytie
    selfing tests, whereas  all of the isolated gametophytes of the tetraploids
    produced sporophytes in the tests.  Based on these developmental and genetic
    features of gametophytes, the dissimilar  mating systems of the diploids and
    the tetraploids of this species are discussed.

    The results of the tests indicated that the gametophytes carried  two or
    more kinds of recessive embryonic lethal factors which were non-allelic with
    each  other and that the occurrence frequency of the gametophytes with an
    identical recessive  lethal factor was 13% to 27% in the gametophyte
    families of these four diploids. The  karyological study of a diploid
    sporophyte suggested not the tetraploid but the diploid  constitution of
    somatic chromosomes. Based on these data, the diploid inheritance of  two or
    three special deleterious genes with a synergistic interaction responsible
    for the  embryonic lethality was hypothesized to elucidate the
    self-sterility in the diploids of this  specie

  abstract: >-
    Phylogenetic divergence-time estimation has been revolutionized by two
    recent developments: 1) total-evidence dating (or “tip-dating”) approaches
    that allow for the incorporation of fossils as tips in the analysis, with
    their phylogenetic and temporal relationships to the extant taxa inferred
    from the data, and 2) the fossilized birth-death (FBD) class of tree models
    that capture the processes that produce the tree (speciation, extinction,
    and fossilization), and thus provide a coherent and biologically
    interpretable tree prior. To explore the behaviour of these methods, we
    apply them to marattialean ferns, a group that was dominant in Carboniferous
    landscapes prior to declining to its modest extant diversity of slightly
    over 100 species. We show that tree models have a dramatic influence on
    estimates of both divergence times and topological relationships. This
    influence is driven by the strong, counter-intuitive informativeness of the
    uniform tree prior and the inherent nonidentifiability of divergence-time
    models. In contrast to the strong influence of the tree models, we find
    minor effects of differing the morphological transition model or the
    morphological clock model. We compare the performance of a large pool of
    candidate models using a combination of posterior-predictive simulation and
    Bayes factors. Notably, an FBD model with epoch-specific speciation and
    extinction rates was strongly favored by Bayes factors. Our best-fitting
    model infers stem and crown divergences for the Marattiales in the
    mid-Devonian and Late Cretaceous, respectively, with elevated speciation
    rates in the Mississippian and elevated extinction rates in the Cisuralian
    leading to a peak diversity of ∼2800 species at the end of the
    Carboniferous, representing the heyday of the Psaroniaceae. This peak is
    followed by the rapid decline and ultimate extinction of the Psaroniaceae,
    with their descendants, the Marattiaceae, persisting at approximately stable
    levels of diversity until the present. This general diversification pattern
    appears to be insensitive to potential biases in the fossil record; despite
    the preponderance of available fossils being from Pennsylvanian coal balls,
    incorporating fossilization-rate variation does not improve model fit. In
    addition, by incorporating temporal data directly within the model and
    allowing for the inference of the phylogenetic position of the fossils, our
    study makes the surprising inference that the clade of extant Marattiales is
    relatively young, younger than any of the fossils historically thought to be
    congeneric with extant species. This result is a dramatic demonstration of
    the dangers of node-based approaches to divergence-time estimation, where
    the assignment of fossils to particular clades are made a priori (earlier
    node-based studies that constrained the minimum ages of extant genera based
    on these fossils resulted in much older age estimates than in our study) and
    of the utility of explicit models of morphological evolution and lineage
    diversification. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared
    no competing interest.

    Chromosome numbers have been widely used to describe the most fundamental
    genomic attribute of an organism or a lineage. Although providing strong
    phylogenetic signal, chromosome numbers vary remarkably among eukaryotes at
    all levels of taxonomic resolution. Changes in chromosome numbers regularly
    serve as indication of major genomic events, most notably polyploidy and
    dysploidy. Here, we review recent advancements in our ability to make
    inferences regarding historical events that led to alterations in the number
    of chromosomes of a lineage. We ﬁrst describe the mechanistic processes
    underlying changes in chromosome numbers, focusing on structural chromosomal
    rearrangements. Then, we focus on experimental procedures, encompassing
    comparative cytogenomics and genomics approaches, and on computational
    methodologies that are based on explicit models of chromosomenumber
    evolution. Together, these tools offer valuable predictions regarding
    historical events that have changed chromosome numbers and genome
    structures, as well as their phylogenetic and temporal placements.

    Homosporous ferns are generally considered polyploid due to high chromosome
    numbers, but genetically diploid since the expression of isozymes is
    generally controlled by a single locus. Gene silencing over evolutionary
    time is one means by which this apparent contradiction can be explained. A
    prediction of this hypothesis is that silenced gene sequences still reside
    in the genomes of homosporous ferns. We examined the genomes ofCeratopteris
    richardii andC. thalictroides for sequences which are similar to expressed
    gene sequences. Genomic DNA blots hybridized withC. richardii cDNA clones
    showed that the majority of these clones detected multiple fragments,
    suggesting that most gene-like sequences are duplicated inCeratopteris.
    Hybridization signal intensity often varied between fragments of the same
    size between accessions, sometimes dramatically, which indicates that not
    all sequences are equivalent, and may represent the products of silenced
    genes. Observed reciprocal differences in intensity could be due to
    reciprocally silenced genes. In addition, an unusual segregation pattern for
    one locus followed by one probe may indicate homeologous chromosome pairing
    and segregation.

    Like many fern lineages comprising reticulate species complexes, Polypodium
    s.s. (Polypodiacaeae) has a history shaped by rapid diversiﬁcation,
    hybridization, and polyploidy that poses substantial challenges for
    phylogenetic inference with plastid and single-locus nuclear markers. Using
    target capture probes for 408 nuclear loci developed by the GoFlag project
    and a custom bioinformatic pipeline, SORTER, we constructed multi-locus
    nuclear datasets for diploid temperate and Mesoamerican species of
    Polypodium and ﬁve allotetraploid species belonging to the well-studied
    Polypodium vulgare complex. SORTER employs a clustering approach to separate
    putatively paralogous copies of targeted loci into orthologous matrices and
    haplotype phasing to infer allopolyploid haplotypes across loci, resulting
    in datasets amenable to both concatenated maximum likelihood and
    multi-species coalescent phylogenetic analyses. By comparing phylogenies
    derived from maximum likelihood and multi-species coalescent analyses of
    unphased and phased datasets, as well as evaluating discordance among gene
    trees and species trees, we recover support for incomplete lineage sorting
    within Polypodium s.s., novel relationships among diploid taxa of the
    Polypodium vulgare complex and its Mesoamerican sister clade, and the
    placement of several Polypodium species within other genera. Additionally,
    we were able to infer well-supported phylogenies that identiﬁed the
    hypothesized progenitors of the allotetraploid species, indicating that
    SORTER is an effective and accurate tool for reconstructing homeolog
    haplotypes of allopolyploids in fern taxa and other nonmodel organisms from
    target capture data.

    Methods: We employed a large target‐capture data set to investigate the
    evolution of genetic, morphological, and ecological variation in P.
    pellucidum. With a broad sampling across ﬁve Hawaiian Islands, we deciphered
    the evolutionary history of P. pellucidum, identiﬁed nonhybrid lineages and
    intraspeciﬁc hybrids, and inferred the relative inﬂuence of geography and
    ecology on their distributions.

    Results: Polypodium pellucidum is monophyletic, dispersing to the Hawaiian
    archipelago 11.53–7.77 Ma and diversifying into extant clades between 5.66
    and 4.73 Ma. We identiﬁed four nonhybrid clades with unique morphologies,
    ecological niches, and distributions. Additionally, we elucidated several
    intraspeciﬁc hybrid combinations and evidence for undiscovered or extinct
    “ghost” lineages contributing to extant hybrid populations.

    Conclusions: We provide a foundation for revising the taxonomy of P.
    pellucidum to account for cryptic lineages and intraspeciﬁc hybrids.
    Geologic succession of the Hawaiian Islands through cycles of volcanism,
    vegetative succession, and erosion has determined the available habitats and
    distribution of ecologically speciﬁc, divergent clades within P. pellucidum.
    Intraspeciﬁc hybrids have likely arisen due to ecological and or geological
    transitions, often persisting after the local extinction of their
    progenitors. This research contributes to our understanding of the evolution
    of Hawai'i's diverse fern ﬂora and illuminated cryptic taxa to allow
    better‐informed conservation eﬀorts.

  abstract: >-
    To resolve phylogenetic relationships among all genera and subgenera in
    Osmundaceae, we analyzed over 8,500 characters of DNA sequence data from
    seven plastid loci (atpA, rbcL, rbcL–accD, rbcL–atpB, rps4–trnS, trnG–trnR,
    and trnL–trnF). Our results confirm those from earlier anatomical and
    single-gene (rbcL) studies that suggested Osmunda s.l. is paraphyletic.
    Osmunda cinnamomea is sister to the remainder of Osmundaceae (Leptopteris,
    Todea, and Osmunda s.s.). We support the recognition of a monotypic fourth
    genus, Osmundastrum, to reflect these results. We also resolve subgeneric
    relationships within Osmunda s.s. and find that subg. Claytosmunda is
    strongly supported as sister to the rest of Osmunda. A stable,
    well-supported classification for extant Osmundaceae is proposed, along with
    a key to all genera and subgenera.

    Wayanad district lies between North latitude 110 26'28" and 110 48'22" and
    East longitude 750 46'38" and 760 26'11". The present study was carried out
    to understand the Pteridophyte flora of Wayanad district. Field trips were
    conducted during 2010-2012 for the collection of Pteridophyte specimens and
    observation of characters. Habit, habitat, morphological characters, etc.,
    were observed in the field itself. A total of 26 families, 67 genera and 152
    species of pteridophytes (Ferns and fern allies) were recorded. Ecological
    nature and economic importance of the collected plants were also noted. The
    pteridophytes were found in the study areas thrive in various habitats. Most
    of them are terrestrials, but hydrophytes, lithophytes, epiphytes,
    rheophytes, xerophyte, wetland/ marshy ferns, etc. were also found. Most of
    them share more than one habitat. Voucher specimens were prepared using

    This work presents the species of Salviniales occurring in the region of
    Vic¸osa, MG, Brazil. There, two species occur naturally (Azolla microphylla
    Kaulf. and Salvinia auriculata Aubl.), three spontaneously (Marsilea
    ancylopoda A. Braun, S. minima Baker, and S. molesta D.S. Mitch.), and one
    in cultivation (S. biloba Raddi). Both S. auriculata and S. molesta form
    dense mats, covering the whole lake areas; S. biloba also forms mats
    throughout its native distribution. We conﬁrmed the alloploidy (pentaploidy)
    of S. molesta, due to the production of only hollow sporangia; we speculate
    aneuploidy for other taxa from Vic¸osa. We also conﬁrmed the presence of
    nitrogen-ﬁxing cyanobacterium, Anabaena azollae Strasburger (Nostocaceae),
    within the fronds of A. microphylla. We provide keys, descriptions,
    illustrations, taxonomic comments, and updated distribution data for all six
    taxa. We also propose new characteristics with taxonomic value and new
    morphological terminology for Salvinia.

    The fern commonly called Cystopteris fragilis (L.) Bernh. var. mackayi Laws.
    (Dryopteridaceae) has been interpreted as either a variety of C. fragilis or
    as a hybrid resulting from introgression between C. fragilis var. fragilis
    and the predominantly southern hemispheric taxon C. diaphana (Bory)
    Blasdell. Neither of these two interpretations correctly reflects its
    evolutionary relationships; rather, var. mackayi appears to be a distinct
    species on the basis of its range, habitat, morphology, and cytology.
    Cystopteris tenuis (Michx.) Desv. is the earliest legitimate name for this
    plant at the specific level.

  abstract: >-
    Nearly all ferns support their stems and leaf axes with a sheath of
    hypodermal sclerenchyma called sterome. The sheath consists of compact
    fibers with few or no intercellular spaces. Although solving the need for
    mechanical support, the sterome presents a problem: it blocks air that has
    diffused through the stomata from diffusing farther into the plant where it
    is needed for photosynthesis and respiration. In most ferns, the blockage is
    overcome by means of aerophores, which typically appear as light-colored
    lines flanking the leaf axes, with one line on either side. Each aerophore
    bears stomata and overlies a parenchymatous gap in the sterome. The gap
    contains intercellular spaces that facilitate the diffusion of air inward
    after it has passed through the stomata. Only rarely do stomata occur off
    the aerophore on areas of adjacent epidermis overlying the hypodermal
    sterome. In such locations, stomata would be useless because air diffusing
    through them would be blocked. In some ferns, aerophores also occur on
    rhizomes in association with decurrent leaf bases. Developmentally,
    aerophores arise from the marginal meristem. As such, they mark the boundary
    between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the leaf. Phylogenetically,
    aerophores constitute a synapomorphy for the clade consisting of the
    Cyatheales and Polypodiales. Within this clade, aerophores have become
    variously modified, including their complete loss, reduction to a single row
    of stomata, co-option as nectaries, and enlargement as peg-like structures
    at the pinna bases of mucilaginous leaves. Aerophores are absent in the
    Marattiaceae, which bear a different type of aerating structure here termed
    a porophore. These are scattered over the leaf axes, appearing as many pale,
    short longitudinal streaks, with each streak bearing a central pore.

  abstract: >-
    Polystichum is one of the most diverse genera of ferns, with 360–400 species
    distributed worldwide. South America harbors ~40 species, clustered in three
    centres of diversity, namely, the Northern and Central Andes Center (NCC),
    the Brazilian Center (BC) and the Southern South America Center (SSC). To
    increase our understanding of the systematic relationships within
    Polystichum, mitotic chromosomes and spore features were studied in nine
    species from Argentina and Chile. All species presented the basic number x =
    41, with different ploidy levels (2x, 4x and 8x). In general, chromosomes
    were homogeneous in size (average length 2.50–5.75 mm) and mostly
    subtelocentric; centromeres were inconspicuous and secondary constrictions
    were frequently observed. All species presented 64 spores per sporangium,
    suggesting normal sexual reproduction. Signiﬁcant differences in spore size
    were found among species and it was positively correlated with ploidy level.
    A relationship between sum total chromosome length and ploidy level was
    observed. However, there was also a reduction in single-chromosome length in
    the polyploids, pointing to genome downsizing. Our results agree with
    previous records, with diploids being frequent among NCC species and absent
    among SSC species. In addition to sharing very speciﬁc morphological
    characters, SSC species are cytologically characterised by being polyploids
    (4x and 8x). A literature survey covering 116 species of Polystichum
    revealed that Australian and New Zealand Polystichum species exhibit
    similarly high frequencies of polyploidy. In the case of P. tetragonum (2n =
    164), endemic to the Juan Fernandez archipelago, our data suggested that it
    was originated by transoceanic migration from a South American ancestor,
    probably also tetraploid.

    Heterosporous water ferns ( Marsileaceae and Salviniaceae) are the only
    extant group of plants to have evolved heterospory since the Paleozoic.
    These ferns possess unusual reproductive structures traditionally termed
    "sporocarps.'' Using an evolutionary framework, we critically examine the
    complex homology issues pertaining to these structures. Comparative
    morphological study reveals that all heterosporous ferns bear indusiate sori
    on a branched, nonlaminate structure that we refer to as the sorophore; this
    expanded definition highlights homology previously obscured by the use of
    different terms. By using a homology- based concept, we aim to discontinue
    the use of historically and functionally based morphological terminology. We
    recognize the sorophore envelope as a structure that surrounds the sorophore
    and sori. The sorophore envelope is present in Marsileaceae as a
    sclerenchymatous sporocarp wall and in Azolla as a parenchymatous layer, but
    it is absent in Salvinia. Both homology assessments and phylogenetic
    character- state reconstructions using the Cretaceous fossil Hydropteris are
    consistent with a single origin of the sorophore envelope in heterosporous
    ferns. Consequently, we restrict the term ''sporocarp'' to a sorophore
    envelope and all it contains. Traditional usage of "sporocarp'' is
    misleading because it implies homology for nonhomologous structures, and
    structures historically called sporocarps in Salviniaceae are more
    appropriately referred to as sori.

  abstract: >-
    Using six plastid regions, we present a phylogeny for 26 species of the
    heterosporous fern genus Marsilea. Two well-supported groups within Marsilea
    are identified. Group I includes two subgroups, and is relatively
    species-poor. Species assignable to this group have glabrous leaves
    (although land leaves may have a few hairs), sporocarps lacking both a raphe
    and teeth, and share a preference for submerged conditions (i.e., they are
    intolerant of desiccation). Group II is relatively diverse, and its members
    have leaves that are pubescent, sporocarps that bear a raphe and from zero
    to two teeth, and the plants are often emergent at the edges of lakes and
    ponds. Within Group II, five subgroups receive robust support: three are
    predominantly African, one is New World, and one Old World. Phylogenetic
    assessment of morphological evolution suggests that the presence of an
    inferior sporocarp tooth and the place of sporocarp maturation are
    homoplastic characters, and are therefore of unreliable taxonomic use at an
    infrageneric level. In contrast, the presence of a raphe and superior
    sporocarp tooth are reliable synapomorphies for classification within
    Marsilea.

    Because ferns have a wide range of habitat preferences and are widely
    distributed, they are an ideal group for understanding how diversity is
    distributed. Here we examine fern diversity on a broad-scale using standard
    and corrected richness measures as well as phylogenetic indices; in addition
    we determine the environmental predictors of each diversity metric. Using
    the combined records of Australian herbaria, a dataset of over 60,000
    records was obtained for 89 genera to infer richness. A molecular phylogeny
    of all the genera was constructed and combined with the herbarium records to
    obtain phylogenetic diversity patterns. A hotspot of both taxic and
    phylogenetic diversity occurs in the Wet Tropics of northeastern Australia.
    Although considerable diversity is distributed along the eastern coast, some
    important regions of diversity are identiﬁed only after
    sample-standardization of richness and through the phylogenetic metric. Of
    all of the metrics, annual precipitation was identiﬁed as the most
    explanatory variable, in part, in agreement with global and regional fern
    studies. However, precipitation was combined with a different variable for
    each different metric. For corrected richness, precipitation was combined
    with temperature seasonality, while correlation of phylogenetic diversity to
    precipitation plus radiation indicated support for the species-energy
    hypothesis. Signiﬁcantly high and signiﬁcantly low phylogenetic diversity
    were found in geographically separate areas. These separate areas correlated
    with different climatic conditions such as seasonality in precipitation. The
    phylogenetic metrics identiﬁed additional areas of signiﬁcant diversity,
    some of which have not been revealed using traditional taxonomic analyses,
    suggesting that different ecological and evolutionary processes have
    operated over the continent. Our study demonstrates that it is possible and
    vital to incorporate evolutionary metrics when inferring biodiversity
    hotspots from large compilations of data.

    The physiological and biochemical mechanisms of organogenesis in Equisetum
    arvense have not been clariﬁed yet. However, high concentrations of nitrogen
    have been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on in vitro tuber formation in
    E. arvense. The aim of this study was to clarify the inﬂuence of the form of
    nitrogen in a medium on in vitro organogenesis in E. arvense. Single-node
    segments of E. arvense rhizomes were cultured in the test medium. The NH4-N
    and NO3-N concentrations of the test medium, respectively, were adjusted by
    adding NH4H2PO4 and KNO3 to the basal medium. The basal medium was a
    nitrogen-free, modiﬁed form of White’s medium. Vegetative shoots were newly
    formed in the test tubes for concentrations of NO3-N and NH4-N that exceeded
    56 mg L−1. However, no rhizome was formed at NH4-N concentrations exceeding
    28 mg L−1. The number of newly formed tubers decreased at an NH4-N
    concentration of 28 mg L−1 and no tuber was formed at NH4-N concentrations
    exceeding 56 mg L−1. In summary, although the presence of NO3-N in the
    medium did not inhibit in vitro rhizome or tuber formation in E. arvense,
    the presence of NH4-N in the medium exerted a strong inhibitory effect on
    the in vitro formation of both of these organs.

    Homosporous ferns have extremely high chromosome numbers relative to
    ﬂowering plants, but the species with the lowest chromosome numbers show
    gene expression patterns typical of diploid organisms, suggesting that they
    may be diploidized ancient polyploids. To investigate the role of polyploidy
    in fern genome evolution, and to provide permanent genetic resources for
    this neglected group, we constructed a high-resolution genetic linkage map
    of the homosporous fern model species, Ceratopteris richardii (n ¼ 39).
    Linkage map construction employed 488 doubled haploid lines (DHLs) that were
    genotyped for 368 RFLP, 358 AFLP, and 3 isozyme markers. Forty-one linkage
    groups were recovered, with average spacing between markers of 3.18 cM. Most
    loci ($76%) are duplicated and most duplicates occur on different linkage
    groups, indicating that as in other eukaryotic genomes, gene duplication
    plays a prominent role in shaping the architecture of fern genomes. Although
    past polyploidization is a potential mechanism for the observed abundance of
    gene duplicates, a wide range in the number of gene duplicates as well as
    the absence of large syntenic regions consisting of duplicated gene copies
    implies that small-scale duplications may be the primary mode of gene
    duplication in C. richardii. Alternatively, evidence of past
    polyploidization(s) may be masked by extensive chromosomal rearrangements as
    well as smaller-scale duplications and deletions following
    polyploidization(s).

    Biological factors involved in reproductive barriers between two divergent
    races of Ceratopteris richardii were investigated. We used a combination of
    spore germination rates, QTL analysis of spore germination rates, and
    transmission ratio distortion (TRD) of 729 RFLPs, AFLPs, and isozyme markers
    distributed across the genome on the basis of hybrid populations of 488
    doubled haploid lines (DHLs) and 168 F2’s. Substantial reproductive barriers
    were found between the parental races, predominantly in the form of spore
    inviability (23.7% F1 spore viability). Intrinsic genetic factors such as
    Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller (BDM) incompatibilities involving both
    nuclear–nuclear and nuclear–cytoplasmic factors and chromosomal
    rearrangements appear to contribute to intrinsic postzygotic isolation. The
    genomewide distribution patterns of TRD loci support the hypothesis that
    reproductive barriers are a byproduct of divergence in allopatry and that
    the strong reproductive barriers are attributable to a small number of
    genetic elements scattered throughout the genome.

    The Gymnogrammoid group of ferns, particularly the Cheilanthoid tribe, is
    phylo-  genetically one of the most controversial among the
    leptosporangiates. The 27 genera  included in the subfamily Gymnogrammoideae
    are regarded by Christensen as of ‘ uncer-  tain mutual relationship and
    probably repreaenting more evolutionary lines, but most of  them no doubt
    related to the Pteridoideae,  with which they are associated by most
    authors’  (Christensen, 1938: 537). The extent of disagreement that
    currently exists regarding the  phylogeny andrelationships of these fernsis
    well reflec  tedin the position attributed to them  in the various systems
    of classification propounded in recent years (Ching, 1940; Copeland,  1947 ;
    Holttum, 1947 ; Alston, 1956). Pellaea and Notholaena belong to the small
    group of  7 or 8 genera constituting the Cheilanthoid tribe (Christensen,
    1938). Bower (1928)  regards them as evolved from the Schizaeoid ferns,
    particularly from genera like Mohria,  though in his opinion the
    relationship is not quite clear. Holttum (1947) supports this  view.
    According to Ching (1940) Cheilanthes and Pellaea (Sinopteridaceae) are
    evolved  from the Hypolepidaceae through the Pteroid stock, and Notholaena
    (Gymnogram-  maceae) is derived from them. Copeland (1947) holds a similar
    view, but he regards Notho-  laem as cogeneric with Cheilanthes, and Pellaea
    as a cognate relative showing close  similarity to Doryopterk : however, in
    his view ‘the real affinities  of the major genera in this  group remain
    obscure’. He considers Actiniopteris as a minor variant of the group and 
    Onychium as a relative.

    Young fronds of ferns are consumed as a vegetable in many countries. The aim
    of this study was to analyze three fern species that are available for sale
    in the Russian Far East as dietary sources in terms of fatty acids that are
    important for human physiology: arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, ARA),
    eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and other valuable long-chain
    polyunsaturated fatty acids. The content of ARA and EPA was 5.5 and 0.5 mg/g
    dry weight, respectively, in Pteridium aquilinum, 4.1 and 1.1 in Matteuccia
    struthiopteris, and 2.2 and 0.8 in Osmundastrum asiaticum. Salted fronds of
    P. aquilinum contained less these fatty acids than the raw fronds, with a
    decrease of up to 49% for ARA and 65% for EPA. These losses were less
    pronounced or even insigniﬁcant in dried fronds. Cooked ferns preserved
    signiﬁcant portions of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids: cooked P.
    aquilinum contained 4.4 mg/g dry weight ARA and 0.3 mg/g dry weight EPA. The
    ferns may provide a supplemental dietary source of these valuable long-chain
    polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially for vegetarian diets.

    Meleagris gallopavo silvestris, Behavior in Central Ontario During Winter.
    Canadian Field-Naturalist 118(2): 251-255. Home range size, food habits, and
    roost site selection are described for the Eastern Wild Turkey (Meleagris
    gallopavo silvestris) introduced on the Precambrian Shield in central
    Ontario during the winters 1999 and 2000. Monthly home range size was
    correlated primarily to snow depth, although it was also likely associated
    to other factors, including food availability and/or roost site
    availability. Ferns and allies were used more than available, whereas
    monocots were used less than expected. Roost site-selection was primarily
    inﬂuenced by tree height. If the Eastern Wild Turkey is to expand its
    northern range in Ontario, winter food and roost site availability may be
    the primary determinants for successful introductions.

    Extensive studies have been done on the Pteridophyte flora of the Malabar
    region, of the Western Ghats, but there are still some serious voids, when
    considering a comprehensive floristic account on the Pteridophytes. The
    Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary is one such area, where no relevant explorations
    were made till date. In the current study a preliminary attempt is made to
    explore and enumerate the fern wealth of Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary in
    Kerala. A total of 79 ferns have been collected and 6 were of threatened
    status.

    Ferns, with about 12,000 species, are the second most diverse lineage of
    vascular plants after angiosperms. They have been the subject of numerous
    molecular phylogenetic studies, resulting in the publication of trees for
    every major clade and DNA sequences from nearly half of all species. Global
    fern phylogenies have been published periodically, but as molecular
    systematics research continues at a rapid pace, these become quickly
    outdated. Here, we develop a mostly automated, reproducible, open pipeline
    to generate a continuously updated fern tree of life (FTOL) from DNA
    sequence data available in GenBank. Our tailored sampling strategy combines
    whole plastomes (few taxa, many loci) with commonly sequenced plastid
    regions (many taxa, few loci) to obtain a global, species-level fern
    phylogeny with high resolution along the backbone and maximal sampling
    across the tips. We use a curated reference taxonomy to resolve synonyms in
    general compliance with the community-driven Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group I
    classification. The current FTOL includes 5,582 species, an increase of
                  ca.
                  40% relative to the most recently published global fern phylogeny. Using an updated and expanded list of 51 fern fossil constraints, we find estimated ages for most families and deeper clades to be considerably older than earlier studies. FTOL and its accompanying datasets, including the fossil list and taxonomic database, will be updated on a regular basis and are available via a web portal (
                  https://fernphy.github.io
                  ) and R packages, enabling immediate access to the most up-to-date, comprehensively sampled fern phylogeny. FTOL will be useful for anyone studying this important group of plants over a wide range of taxonomic scales, from smaller clades to the entire tree. We anticipate FTOL will be particularly relevant for macroecological studies at regional to global scales and will inform future taxonomic systems with the most recent hypothesis of fern phylogeny.

    Abstract
                Evolution is a continuous trial and error process in which most lineages go extinct without leaving fossil remains. Many of these lineages would be closely related and occasionally hybridized with lineages that gave rise to extant species. Hence, it is likely that one can find genetic signatures of these ancient introgression events in present‐day genomes, so‐called ghost introgression. The increasing availability of high‐quality genome assemblies for non‐model organisms and the development of more sophisticated methods for detecting introgression will undoubtedly reveal more cases of ghost introgression, indicating that the Tree of Life is even more reticulated than assumed. The presence of ghost introgression has important consequences for the study of numerous evolutionary processes, including adaptation, speciation, and macroevolutionary patterns. In addition, detailed studies of introgressed regions could provide insights into the morphology of the extinct lineage, providing an unexpected link between genomics and the fossil record. Hence, new methods that take into account ghost introgression will need to be developed.

    The fern family Polypodiaceae plays an important role in Neotropical
    epiphyte diversity. Most of its American representatives are assembled in a
    monophyletic clade that, apart from the grammitids, nearly exclusively
    comprises species restricted to the New World. The phylogenetic
    relationships of these ferns are still insufﬁciently understood and many
    taxonomic problems, such as natural circumscriptions of the genera
    Polypodium and Pleopeltis, were unresolved. Here we address one of the two
    main lineages within New World Polypodiaceae including Pecluma, Phlebodium,
    Pleopeltis, and Polypodium. Our study is based on DNA sequence data from
    four plastid regions that were generated for 72 species representing all
    putative major taxonomic groups within this lineage. The analyses reveal
    three major clades: (1) Polypodium plus Pleurosoriopsis; (2) Pecluma plus
    Phlebodium, and some species of Polypodium; and (3) Pleopeltis and related
    genera. The last clade contains species of Pleopeltis and Polypodium as well
    as Microphlebodium, Neurodium, Dicranoglossum, and Pseudocolysis. All
    species included in the clade display conspicuous persistent peltate laminar
    scales that are not found in other species of this lineage. Our results
    suggest a reconsideration of the generic concept of Pleopeltis with peltate
    laminar scales being the genus’ key character.

    The reproductive biology of Cryptogramma crispa, a tetraploid species with a
    broad circumboreal and alpine distribution, growing mainly in siliceous
    boulder fields and crevices, was studied in the laboratory by growing
    gametophytes in plates with both solidified agar media and sterilized soil.
    In addition, an electrophoretic study of isozymes was carried out on frond
    samples from five natural populations, as an additional source of evidence
    concerning the breeding system and the genetic structure of sporophyte
    populations. Populations throughout the Iberian range of the species were
    selected for this study, and a Scottish population was included to represent
    plants from outside our local area and ecology. The morphological
    development of gametophytes is of the Adiantum type. All multispore cultures
    developed into a bigametophytic system, consisting in most cases of male and
    female prothalli. This pattern of sexual expression provides evidence for
    outcrossing as the main breeding system in this species. Moreover, there is
    good evidence that the species possesses an antheridiogen system to promote
    outcrossing. The long time needed by gametophytes to produce gametangia, and
    afterwards to fertilize and produce sporophytes, might be the primary reason
    why so few young sporophytes are found in the wild. The values of the
    percentage of polymorphic loci and the similarity levels obtained from the
    isozyme analyses indicate a level of genetic variability that would be
    expected in an outcrossing species. All these characteristics are usually
    associated with diploid fern species rather than polyploid species.

    Environmental sex determination is present in several animal and plant
    lineages. Diverse factors such as temperature, light or water availability
    have been described as sex determinants in these organisms. Among plants,
    ferns frequently display ESD. This work compares the effect of different
    levels of water availability in two diploid species of the xerophytic fern
    genus Cheilanthes and in their derived tetraploid, and if they are sensitive
    to antheridiogen (i.e. maleness-inducing pheromone). Different watering
    regimes were applied to isolated gametophyte cultures of the three study
    species. Gametophyte survival, size, gender and sporophyte production were
    assessed after 13, 18 and 23 weeks of culture. Cultures combining spores and
    adult gametophytes were established to test the effect of antheridiogen.
    Isolated gametophytes had an asexual to female to bisexual sequence that did
    not depend upon the degree of soil moisture. Both gender expression and
    growth reduction in response to water scarcity of the allotetraploid were
    more similar to those of one of the diploid parents. In all watering
    regimes, survival was higher in the allotetraploid, suggesting hybrid
    vigour, whereas automixis rate was similar in the three species and reached
    ∼50 % at high moisture. This breeding system can ensure reproduction in the
    absence of males. In the three species, female gametophytes produced
    antheridiogens that enhanced maleness. This promotes a mixed mating system
    that could be favourable for ferns growing in xeric habitats.

    In the mitochondria and chloroplasts of flowering plants (angiosperms),
    transcripts of protein-coding genes are altered after synthesis so that
    their final primary nucleotide sequence differs from that of the
    corresponding DNA sequence. This posttranscriptional mRNA editing consists
    almost exclusively of C-to-U substitutions (direct) and less frequently of
    U-to-C substitution (reverse). Editing occurs predominantly within coding
    regions, mostly at isolated C residues, and usually at first or second
    positions of codons, thereby almost always changing the amino acid from that
    specified by the unedited codon. Editing may also create initiation and
    termination codons. The effect of C-to-U RNA editing in plants is to make
    proteins encoded by plant organelles more similar in sequence to their non
    plant homologs, then specific C-toU editing events are essential for the
    production of functional plant mitochondrial proteins. Our attention has
    been devoted to the study of the mRNA editing in cox3 mitochondrial gene of
    fern Asplenium nidus. This study reveals the extreme importance of both
    C-to-U and U-to-C substitutions for protein expression.

    Insect-fern interaction from Andaman Island is described as a rare event of
    phytophagy by the coccid. The coccid infests the fronds of bird nest fern
    Asplenium nidus, a common green-house ornamental fern and develops
    opportunistic feeding niche on the abaxial surface. Coccid densities vary
    significantly (t = 5.74, p = 0.05) between vegetative and fertile fronds of
    the fern where fertile fronds supporting higher mean coccid densities (18.46
    ± 1.9) than do vegetative fronds (5.97 ± 0.5). In fertile fronds coccids are
    camouflaged to the sori of the fern to avoid predation. Silvery- white
    patches on the frond surface corresponding to the position of coccids are
    recorded suggesting the effect of coccid feeding on the host fern. Tough and
    lathery fronds of the fern are free of other competitive herbivores.

    Over the past 14 years, an effort was made to summarize and improve our
    knowledge of the Arkansas pteridophyte flora beyond that developed by Taylor
    and Demaree (1979). They presented a flora of 68 species plus 2 varieties
    plus 4 hybrids, for a total of 74 taxa vouchered with 1335 county-level
    occurrence records. Changes in accepted nomenclature, field work, and
    herbaria searches have added as new to the flora 10 species plus 1 variety
    plus 7 hybrids, supported with 74 county-level occurrence records. Another
    815 county-level occurrence records were added to the known flora. The
    Arkansas pteridophyte flora now consists of 78 species plus 3 varieties plus
    11 hybrids, supported with 2224 county-level occurrence records. Achecklist,
    92 distribution maps, a history of Arkansas pteridophyte floristics,
    corrective nomenclatural notes, and a phylogeny based on a recent national
    treatment on pteridophytes are provided.

  abstract: >-
    Ferns are the second largest clade of vascular plants with over 10,000
    species, yet the generation of genomic resources for the group has lagged
    behind other major clades of plants. Transcriptomic data have proven to be a
    powerful tool to assess phylogenetic relationships, using thousands of
    markers that are largely conserved across the genome, and without the need
    to sequence entire genomes. We assembled the largest nuclear phylogenetic
    dataset for ferns to date, including 2884 single-copy nuclear loci from 247
    transcriptomes (242 ferns, ﬁve outgroups), and investigated phylogenetic
    relationships across the fern tree, the placement of whole genome
    duplications (WGDs), and gene retention patterns following WGDs. We
    generated a well-supported phylogeny of ferns and identiﬁed several regions
    of the fern phylogeny that demonstrate high levels of gene tree–species tree
    conﬂict, which largely correspond to areas of the phylogeny that have been
    difﬁcult to resolve. Using a combination of approaches, we identiﬁed 27 WGDs
    across the phylogeny, including 18 largescale events (involving more than
    one sampled taxon) and nine small-scale events (involving only one sampled
    taxon). Most inferred WGDs occur within single lineages (e.g., orders,
    families) rather than on the backbone of the phylogeny, although two
    inferred events are shared by leptosporangiate ferns (excluding Osmundales)
    and Polypodiales (excluding Lindsaeineae and Saccolomatineae), clades which
    correspond to the majority of fern diversity. We further examined how
    retained duplicates following WGDs compared across independent events and
    found that functions of retained genes were largely convergent, with
    processes involved in binding, responses to stimuli, and certain organelles
    over-represented in paralogs while processes involved in transport,
    organelles derived from endosymbiotic events, and signaling were
    under-represented. To date, our study is the most comprehensive
    investigation of the nuclear fern phylogeny, though several avenues for
    future research remain unexplored.

    Isoetes dubsii sp. nov. and I. santacruzensis sp. nov., two new species from
    lowland areas in South America, are described, illustrated and compared to
    similar species. Isoetes dubsii can be distinguished from other species of
    the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands by a set of characters including leaves that
    are long,  exuous and trigonal in transverse section, tri-lobate stems,
    rudimentary velum, pustulate megaspores of 310‒390 μm diameter and laesurae
    of the megaspore at least four times wider than high. Isoetes santacruzensis
    has  exu- ous,  liform leaves, 0.4–0.8 mm wide at mid length and reaching up
    to 15 cm long, black or reddish-black sporangia, scleri ed phyllopodia and
    sparsely verrucate megaspores of 320‒390 μm in diameter. We also include a
    key for species from the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands and Bolivia and spore
    images for all species that are discussed. Isoetes dubsii and I.
    santacruzensis are only known from their type localities and they may
    deserve special attention concerning their conservation status. However,
    based on our current knowledge on these species and according to IUCN Red
    List criteria, they are assessed here as data de cient (DD).

    Evidence is provided for the first demonstrated example of allopolyploidy in
    the New Zealand fern flora. Cytological, morphological, and molecular
    (AFLP-DNA fingerprinting) analyses indicate that the fern previously known
    as Polystichum richardii constitutes an allopolyploid complex, in which four
    separate evolutionary lineages are present. These are here recognised as
    three taxonomic species, with one of these encompassing two subspecies. The
    two allooctoploid lineages are accommodated under the reinstated name P.
    neozelandicum, each as a separate subspecies: P. neozelandicum subsp.
    neozelandicum and the new combination P. neozelandicum subsp.

  type: article-journal

- id: perrie2010parallel
  abstract: >-
    Although polyploidy is widespread, its significance to the generation of
    biodiversity remains unclear. Many polyploids have been derived recurrently.
    For a particular polyploid, gene-flow between the products of independent
    origin is typical where they come into contact. Here, we use AFLP
    DNA-fingerprinting and chloroplast DNA sequences to demonstrate parallel
    polyploid speciation within both of the ferns Asplenium cimmeriorum and A.
    gracillimum. Both of these taxa comprise at least two allopolyploids,
    recurrently derived from the same progenitor pair. Each of these
    allopolyploids remain genetically distinguishable even with extensive
    sympatry, and could therefore be considered distinct species. To our
    knowledge, parallel speciation on this scale amongst recurrent polyploids
    has not been previously reported. With their parallel origins, these
    ‘evolutionary replicates’ provide an unrivalled opportunity to investigate
    how the reproductive barriers and ecological differentiation necessary for
    speciation arise following polyploidy.

    The fern genus
                  Microsorum
                  is not monophyletic, with previous phylogenetic analyses finding three lineages to group not with the type species, but to form a grade related to the 13 species of
                  Lecanopteris
                  . These three lineages have recently been recognised as separate
     genera:
                  Bosmania
                  ,
                  Dendroconche
                  , and
                  Zealandia
                  . Here, we explore the morphological characterisation of
                  Lecanopteris
                  and these other three lecanopteroid genera. While the\ traditional circumscription of
                  Lecanopteris
                  has seemed sacrosanct, its defining morphological
     character states of rhizome cavities and ant brooding associations occur in other lecanopteroid ferns and elsewhere in the
                  Polypodiaceae
                  . Instead, we suggest that the morphological characterisation of an expanded
                  Lecanopteris
                  including the
                  Dendroconche
                  and
                  Zealandia
                  lineages is just as good, if not better, with the pertinent character states being the absence of sclerenchyma strands in the rhizome and atleast some fronds having Nooteboom's type 5 venation pattern. This wider circumscription is also better able to accommodate phylogenetic uncertainty,
     and it means that groups of species traditionally placed together in a single genus are not distributed across different genera. General users familiar with the narrower circumscription of
                  Lecanopteris
                  will not be significantly disrupted, because there is little geographic overlap with
     the lineages added to the genus. Consequently, we make new combinations in
                  Lecanopteris
                  for 11 species and one subspecies.

  abstract: >-
    The rapid proliferation of giant Salvinia (GS; Salvinia molesta) in various
    hydrostatic environments, such as ponds and paddy fields, poses a threat to
    water quality due to light obstruction. Thus, this study aimed to transform
    GS biomass into hydrochar or solid biofuel via hydrothermal carbonization
    (HTC). Several parameters were examined, including residence time, reaction
    temperature, and liquid-to-solid mass ratio (L/S). The Box-Behnken Design
    (BBD) was also employed to set the experimental conditions at three levels
    and factors. The examinations of reaction temperature (200–220 °C),
    residence time (2–6 h), and L/S ratio (12–20) were conducted. The physical
    and chemical characteristics of hydrochar were further analyzed to encompass
    higher heating value (HHV), proximate analysis, ultimate analysis,
    functional group, and morphology. The percent energy recovery (ER, %) was
    remarked for the experimental design response. The kinetic analysis and a
    comprehensive combustibility index, calculated from TGA/DTG curves, were
    employed to elucidate the combustion behavior of hydrochar. The optimal
    condition for hydrochar production, resulting in maximal ER, was identified
    at 220 °C, 6 h, with an L/S ratio of 16. The corresponding fixed carbon
    (FC), HHV, and mass yield were approximately 17.2%, 23.5 MJ/kg, and 51.4%,
    respectively. The H/C and O/C mole ratios in the sub-bituminous coal region.
    This study affirms the feasibility of converting GS biomass into a renewable
    fuel resembling low-rank coal.

    The majority of homosporous ferns have a chromosome number that is
    severalfold greater than that of diploid seed plants. These fern species
    have therefore been generally considered to be of polyploid origin. Enzyme
    electrophoretic investigations have demonstrated, however, that within fern
    genera, species having the lowest chromosome numbers (n = 27-52) have the
    number of isozymes typical of diploid seed plants; there is no isozyme
    evidence for polyploidy of these plants. We have constructed a genomic DNA
    library from Polystichum munitum (n = 41), a homosporous fern, and have
    screened the library for sequences homologous to the chlorophyll a/b-binding
    (CAB) protein genes of higher plants. The majority of the sequences isolated
    and characterized by nucleotide sequence determination represent defective
    CAB genes. This result is in contrast to the situation in the genomes of
    diploid angiosperms, where most, and sometimes all, copies of the CAB gene
    family represent functional members. Several hypotheses could explain the
    existence of multiple defective CAB genes in P. munitum. (i) The defective
    CAB genes are the result of "gene silencing" following polyploidy. (ii) P.
    munitum has not gone through a polyploidization event, but several, and
    perhaps the majority, of its CAB genes have mutated to a nonfunctional state
    (a phenomenon not yet observed in any of the genomes of non-fern plants so
    far examined). (iii) Some defective CAB genes have been specifically
    amplified in the genome of P. munitum.

    Anatomically preserved Woodwardia virginica (Blechnaceae) and a newly
    recognized onocleoid fern are described from the middle Miocene Yakima
    Canyon flora of central Washington State, USA. Identification of the W.
    virginica fossils is based on a combination of vegetative pinnules, rhizome
    and stipe anatomy, and fertile pinnules with indusiate sori and sporangia
    Like those of extant W. virginica. Fronds are isomorphic. Vegetative pinnae
    are elongated and pinnatifid, with a secondary vein paralleling the midvein.
    Secondary veins of the pinnule lobe anastomose to form primary areoles and
    are either simple or dicholomize toward the margin. Rhizomes have a simple
    dictyostele with 3-5 cauline vascular bundles and often a sclerotic
    hypodermis. Leaf traces contain two large adaxial vascular bundles that
    occur laterally and adaxially, flanking an are of 4-6 smaller bundles.
    Fertile pinnules have linear sori that are somewhat embedded in the laminae
    and are enclosed by a thin indusium. Leptosporangia display a vertical
    annulus and an elongated stalk. A second fern, Wessiea yakimaensis gen. et
    sp. nov., is represented by anatomically preserved branching rhizomes and
    attached frond bases that conform to the Onoclea-type pattern of rhizome and
    frond-base vasculature. Rhizomes have a simple dictyostele of 4-5 cauline
    meristeles. Leaf divergence is helical, with paired hippocampiform rachial
    traces. These two ferns occur in the same matrix with specimens of Osmunda
    wehrii. They demonstrate that filicalean fern assemblages similar to those
    of extant temperate floras were well established in western North America by
    the middle Miocene and further emphasize the exceptional species longevity
    of some homosporous pteridophytes.

    Abstract
                
                  Background
                  Genome size is influenced by natural selection and genetic drift acting on variations from polyploidy and repetitive DNA sequences. We hypothesized that centromere drive, where centromeres compete for inclusion in the functional gamete during meiosis, may also affect genome and chromosome size. This competition occurs in asymmetric meiosis, where only one of the four meiotic products becomes a gamete. If centromere drive influences chromosome size evolution, it may also impact post-polyploid diploidization, where a polyploid genome is restructured to function more like a diploid through chromosomal rearrangements, including fusions. We tested if plant lineages with asymmetric meiosis exhibit faster chromosome size evolution compared to those with only symmetric meiosis, which lack centromere drive as all four meiotic products become gametes. We also examined if positive selection on centromeric histone H3 (CENH3), a protein that can suppress centromere drive, is more frequent in these asymmetric lineages.
                
                
                  Methods
                  We analysed plant groups with different meiotic modes: asymmetric in gymnosperms and angiosperms, and symmetric in bryophytes, lycophytes and ferns. We selected species based on available CENH3 gene sequences and chromosome size data. Using Ornstein–Uhlenbeck evolutionary models and phylogenetic regressions, we assessed the rates of chromosome size evolution and the frequency of positive selection on CENH3 in these clades.
                
                
                  Results
                  Our analyses showed that clades with asymmetric meiosis have a higher frequency of positive selection on CENH3 and increased rates of chromosome size evolution compared to symmetric clades.
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  Our findings support the hypothesis that centromere drive accelerates chromosome and genome size evolution, potentially also influencing the process of post-polyploid diploidization. We propose a model which in a single framework helps explain the stability of chromosome size in symmetric lineages (bryophytes, lycophytes and ferns) and its variability in asymmetric lineages (gymnosperms and angiosperms), providing a foundation for future research in plant genome evolution.

    Woodsiaceae is a monophyletic fern family comprising around 65 taxa that
    inhabit mainly mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere but also with
    numerous species in southern America and Africa. Recent molecular studies
    recognize two genera in the family: Woodsia, restricted to the northern
    hemisphere, and Physematium, present in Central and South America, Africa
    and East Asia. Traditionally, in South America the family has been
    considered to include a single species, Woodsia montevidensis, very variable
    morphologically, a treatment that underestimates the diversity of South
    American taxa. Therefore, we carried out a taxonomic review that included
    comparative analyses of morphological and palynological characters as well
    as distributional data. In the Southern Cone, Physematium is characterized
    by sori with saucer- or bowl-shaped lower indusia, splitting into 1–3 lobes
    in the mature sori. The taxa inhabit mountainous regions, between 200 m to
    more than 4000 m in altitude. Four species are recognized in the genus
    Physematium in the Southern Cone: one new species, P. hieronymi, and three
    that were previously treated as synonyms of P. montevidense, publishing here
    the corresponding new combinations. A key, descriptions, illustrations and
    distribution maps of the species are provided.

    Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Todaro is a fern which occurs throughout the
    north temperate and sub-boreal zones of the northern hemisphere including
    all provinces and territories of Canada, the northern U.S., Japan, China,
    Siberia west to Scandinavia, Belgium, France and parts of the Alps. Its
    occurrence may be considered as an indicator of moist eutrophic soils where
    the water table is generally within 1.5 m ofthe soil surface. The young
    vegetative fronds or “‘fiddleheads” that emerge in the spring have beena
    traditional part ofthe diet of the Malecite Indians of New Brunswick. These
    fiddleheads are an edible, nutritious vegetable that is considered to have
    potential as a cultivated crop.

    As part of a systematic investigation of the genus Gyrnrzocnrpiiirn in North
    America, a survey of chromatographic profiles in  species and hybrids of the
    genus was initiated. It was established through cluster analysis and
    ordinationof the phenolic data that  morphologically distinguishable taxa of
    Gytnnocnrpiunz can be recognized by their chromatographic profiles alone.
    These data  provide supportive evidence for the recognition of G.
    robertinnum and G. jessoerzse ssp. pnrvulurn as distinct taxa and for the 
    hybrid status of G. X intermediurn. They also suggest that, as currently
    circumscribed, G. jessoer~se ssp. jessoense is a  heterogeneous taxon.

    Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the variation in perispore
    characters within and between six currently recognized taxa of the genus
    Gymnocarpium Newm. in North America. Representative scanning electron
    micrographs are presented and depict the perispore features observed. Spores
    of those taxa studied here do not each possess a distinctive morphology
    providing practical species discrimination, rather they all exhibit similar
    patterns of variation. Spore size was also examined and shown to be
    correlated to ploidy level, permitting positive identification of the
    diploid taxon G. dryopteris ssp. disjunctum from the tetraploid G.
    dryopteris ssp. dryopteris.

    A critical examination of isozyme, chromosomal, and morphological characters
    in subspecies formerly included in Gymnocarpium dryopteris demonstrated that
    three sexual taxa can be distinguished. We recognize these taxa as distinct
    species: the widespread, fertile allotetraploid G. dryopteris, with one
    genome derived from the western diploid G. disjunctum and the other from G.
    appalachianum sp. nov., a previously undetected eastern North American
    diploid, which is described and illustrated here and for which we report a
    chromosome number of 2n = 80. Population comparisons of allele frequencies
    between G. disjunctum and G. appalachianum yielded an average Nei's genetic
    identity value (I) of 0.274. A wide-ranging assemblage of putatively
    triploid plants with both sterile, malformed spores and large, round spores
    capable of germination is believed to represent the backcrosses G.
    disjunctum x dryopteris and G. appalachianum x dryopteris. The name G. x
    brittonianum comb. nov. is applied here to G. disjunctum x dryopteris. A key
    to fertile species, species descriptions and illustrations, distribution
    maps, and habitat notes are included.

    We present the first cladistic analysis of extant ferns based on
    morphological characters. Our data set consisted of 77 vegetative and
    reproductive morphological/anatomical characters recorded on a broad
    sampling of 50 extant pteridophyte taxa, with representatives of all major
    fern groups, and one seed plant (Cycas). An annotated list of both retained
    and excluded morphological characters is presented. Results from the
    morphological analysis are compared with an independent analysis of rbcL
    data carried out here for the same set of pteridophyte taxa. Finally, we
    analyze a combined (morphological and molecular) data set. All three data
    sets were analyzed using maximum parsimony. Two separate sets of analyses
    using different taxon combinations were conducted on each of the three data
    sets. Analysis 1 focused on phylogenetic relationships of ferns only
    (Filicopsida, Botrychium, and Angiopteris), using Cycas as an outgroup
    representative from the seed plants. Analysis 2 focused on phylogenetic
    relationships of pteridophytes (Filicopsida, Angiopteris, Botrychium,
    Equisetum, Psilotum), using Lycopodium as the outgroup. In both sets of
    analyses, the combined data set provided the most robustly supported
    hypothesis of relationships. Results from the combined data set in Analysis
    1 provided strong bootstrap support for the monophyly of the following
    clades: leptosporangiate ferns (with Osmunda as the most basal
    leptosporangiate fern), heterosporous ferns, Cheiropleuria-Dipteris,
    Diplopterygium-Stromatopteris, tree ferns, schizaeoid ferns, pteridoid
    ferns, and a large clade consisting of a derived group of leptosporangiate
    ferns that excludes dennstaedtioids and pteridoids. Various smaller clades
    within some of these larger clades also have strong support. The
    dennstaedtioid ferns are paraphyletic. We use the results of the combined
    data set in Analysis 1 to examine character evolution within the
    leptosporangiate ferns. Results from the combined data set in Analysis 2
    indicated robust support for essentially the same fern clades as the
    combined data set in Analysis 1. In both Analyses 1 and 2, bootstrap support
    for the leptosporangiate fern clade is much greater using the combined data
    set than when either the morphological or, particularly, the molecular data
    set is analyzed separately. Relationships among major groups of
    pteridophytes at the base of the tree (Botrychium, Angiopteris, Psilotum,
    Equisetum, Lycopodium) were poorly supported by the combined data in
    Analysis 2, except for a weak association between Botrychium and Psilotum.
    We are convinced from this study of the value of using both molecular and
    morphological data sets in combination as well as separately. A synthetic
    approach that integrates paleobotanical and neobotanical data will be of
    greatest interest in further elucidating the phylogenetic relationships of
    pteridophytes.

    Phylogenetic relationships of extant ferns based on evidence from morphology

  type: article-journal

  abstract: >-
    Recent phylogenetic studies have provided compelling evidence that confirms
    the once disputed hypothesis of monophyly for heterosporous leptosporangiate
    ferns (Marsileaceae and Salviniaceae). Hypotheses for relationships among
    the three genera of Marsileaceae (Marsilea, Regnellidium, and Pilularia),
    however, have continued to be in conflict. The phylogeny of Marsileaceae is
    investigated here using information from morphology and rbcL sequence data.
    In addition, relationships among all heterosporous ferns, including the
    whole-plant fossil Hydropteris pinnata are reconsidered. Data sets of 71
    morphological and 1239 rbcL characters for 23 leptosporangiate ferns,
    including eight heterosporous ingroup taxa and 15 homosporous outgroup taxa,
    were subjected to maximum parsimony analysis. Morphological analyses were
    carried out both with and without the fossil Hydropteris, and it was
    excluded from all analyses with rbcL data. An annotated list of the 71
    morphological characters is provided in the appendix. For comparative
    purposes, the Rothwell and Stockey (1994) data set was also reanalyzed here.
    The best estimate of phylogenetic relationships for Marsileaceae in all
    analyses is that Pilularia and Regnellidium are sister taxa and Marsilea is
    sister to that clade. Morphological synapomorphies for various nodes are
    discussed. Analyses that included Hydropteris resulted in two
    most-parsimonious trees that differ only in the placement of the fossil. One
    topology is identical to the relationship found by Rothwell and Stockey
    (1994), placing the fossil sister to the Azolla plus Salvinia clade. The
    alternative topology places Hydropteris as the most basal member of the
    heterosporous fern clade. Equivocal interpretations for character evolution
    in heterosporous ferns are discussed in the context of these two
    most-parsimonious trees. Because of the observed degree of character
    ambiguity, the phylogenetic placement of Hydropteris is best viewed as
    unresolved, and recognition of the suborder Hydropteridineae, as
    circumscribed by Rothwell and Stockey (1994), is regarded as premature. The
    two competing hypotheses of relationships for heterosporous ferns are also
    compared with the known temporal distribution of relevant taxa.
    Stratigraphic fit of the phylogenetic estimates is measured by using the
    Stratigraphic Consistency Index and by comparison with minimum divergence
    times.

    Most of the 470-million-year history of plants on land belongs to
    bryophytes, pteridophytes and gymnosperms, which eventually yielded to the
    ecological dominance by angiosperms 90 Myr ago(1-3). Our knowledge of
    angiosperm phylogeny, particularly the branching order of the earliest
    lineages, has recently been increased by the concurrence of multigene
    sequence analyses(4-6). However, reconstructing relationships for all the
    main lineages of vascular plants that diverged since the Devonian period has
    remained a challenge. Here we report phylogenetic analyses of combined
    data-from morphology and from four genes-for 35 representatives from all the
    main lineages of land plants. We show that there are three monophyletic
    groups of extant vascular plants: (1) lycophytes, (2) seed plants and (3) a
    clade including equisetophytes (horsetails), psilotophytes (whisk ferns) and
    all eusporangiate and leptosporangiate ferns. Our maximum-likelihood
    analysis shows unambiguously that horsetails and ferns together are the
    closest relatives to seed plants. This refutes the prevailing view that
    horsetails and ferns are transitional evolutionary grades between bryophytes
    and seed plants(7), and has important implications for our understanding of
    the development and evolution of plants(8).

    The "filmy fern" family, Hymenophyllaceae. is traditionally partitioned into
    two principal genera, Trichomanes s.l. (sensu lato) and Hymenophyllum s.l.,
    based upon sorus shape characters. This basic split in the family has been
    widely debated this past century and hence was evaluated here by using rbcL
    nucleotide sequence data in a phylogenetic study of 26 filmy ferns and nine
    outgroup taxa. Our results confirm the monophyly of the family and provide
    robust support for two monophyletic groups th;lt correspond to the tw
    classical genera. In addition, we show that some taxa of uncertain affinity,
    such as the monotypic genera Cardiomanes and Serpyllopsis, and at least one
    species of Microtrichomanes, are convincingly included within Hymenophyllum
    s.l. the tubular- or conical-based sorus that typifies Trichomanes s.l, and
    Cardiomanes, the most basal member of Hymenophyllum s.l. is a plesiomorphic
    character state for the family. Tubular-based sori occurring in other
    members of Hymenophyllum s.l. are most likely derived independently and more
    than one time. While rbcL data are able to provide a well-supported
    phylogenetic estimate within Trichomanes s.l.. they are inadequate for
    resolving relationships within Hymenophyllum s.l.. which will require data
    from additional sources. This disparity in resolution reflects differential
    rates of evolution for rbcL within Hymenophyllaceae.

    Recent comparative DNA-sequencing studies of chloroplast, mitochondrial and
    ribosomal genes have produced an evolutionary tree relating the diversity of
    green-plant lineages. By coupling this phylogenetic framework to the
    explosion of information on genome content, plant-genomic efforts can and
    should be extended beyond angiosperm crop and model systems. Including plant
    species representative of other crucial evolutionary nodes would produce the
    comparative information necessary to understand fully the organization,
    function and evolution of plant genomes. The simultaneous development of
    genomic tools for green algae, bryophytes,'seed-free' vascular plants and
    gymnosperms should provide insights into the bases of the complex
    morphological, physiological, reproductive and biochemical innovations that
    have characterized the successful transition of green plants to land.

    Using cheilanthoid ferns, we provide an example of how DNA barcoding
    approaches can be useful to the horticultural community for keeping plants
    in the trade accurately identified. We use plastid rbcL, atpA, and trnG-R
    sequence data to demonstrate that a fern marketed as Cheilanthes wrightii
    (endemic to the southwestern USA and northern Mexico) in the horticultural
    trade is, in fact, Cheilanthes distans (endemic to Australia and adjacent
    islands). Public and private (accessible with permission) databases contain
    a wealth of DNA sequence data that are linked to vouchered plant material.
    These data have uses beyond those for which they were originally generated,
    and they provide an important resource for fostering collaborations between
    the academic and horticultural communities. We strongly advocate the
    barcoding approach as a valuable new technology available to the
    horticulture industry to help correct plant identification errors in the
    international trade. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

  abstract: >-
    © 2016 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. Across the tree of
    life, molecular phylogenetic studies often reveal surprising relationships
    between taxa with radically different morphologies that have long obscured
    their close affiliations. A spectacular botanical example is Rafflesia, a
    holoparasite that produces the largest flowers in the world, but that
    evolved from tiny-flowered ancestors within the Euphorbiaceae. Outside of
    parasitic lineages, such abrupt transformations are rarely seen. One
    exception involves the "maidenhair ferns" (Adiantum), which are
    quintessential ferns: beautifully dissected, terrestrial, and shade loving.
    The closely related "shoestring ferns" (vittarioids), in contrast, have an
    extremely simplified morphology, are canopy-dwelling epiphytes, and exhibit
    greatly accelerated rates of molecular evolution. While Adiantum and the
    vittarioids together have been shown to form a robust monophyletic group
    (adiantoids), there remain unanswered questions regarding the monophyly of
    Adiantum and the evolutionary history of the vittarioids. Here we review
    recent phylogenetic evidence suggesting support for the monophyly of
    Adiantum, and analyze new plastid data to confirm this result. We find that
    Adiantum is monophyletic and sister to the vittarioids. With this robust
    phylogenetic framework established for the broadest relationships in the
    adiantoid clade, we can now focus on understanding the evolutionary
    processes associated with the extreme morphological, ecological, and genetic
    transitions that took place within this lineage.

    The genus Angiopteris is known to occur from Madagascar to the Pacific
    islands and from India and southern Japan to northern Australia. The number
    of species in this genus is highly debatable, from a single species
    (Angiopteris evecta) to about 200 poorly defined micro species (Mabberley
    1997). Holttum (1978) pointed out that A. evecta (G. Forst) Hoffm, was the
    first described species from the Society Island of Tahiti and it differs
    significantly from the Indian and Asian mainland plants. Fraser-Jenkins
    (2008, 2009) recognised three distinct species (A. helferiana, A. indica and
    A palmiformis) in Indian subcontinent.

  title: The deepest divergences in land plants inferred from phylogenomic evidence
  type: article-journal
  volume: '103'

- id: qiu2007nonflowering
  abstract: >-
    Nucleotide sequences of seven chloroplast (atpB and rbcL, SSU and LSU
    rDNAs), mitochondrial (atp1, LSU rDNA), and nuclear (18S rDNA) genes from
    192 land plants and their algal relatives were analyzed using maximum
    likelihood and maximum parsimony methods. Liverworts, mosses, hornworts,
    lycophytes, monilophytes (ferns), seed plants, and angiosperms all represent
    strongly supported monophyletic groups. Three bryophyte lineages form a
    paraphyletic group to vascular plants, with liverworts representing the
    sister to all other land plants and hornworts being sister to vascular
    plants. Lycophytes are sister to all other vascular plants, which are
    divided into two clades, one being monilophytes, which include Equisetum,
    Psilotaceae- Ophioglossaceae, Marattiaceae, and leptosporangiate ferns, and
    the other being seed plants. Relationships among the monilophyte lineages
    remain unresolved. Within seed plants, extant gymnosperms form a moderately
    supported clade in which Gnetales are related to conifers. This clade is
    sister to angiosperms. Most of the relationships among all major lineages of
    nonflowering land plants are supported by bootstrap values of 75% or higher,
    except those among basal monilophyte lineages and among some gymnosperm
    lineages, probably because of extinctions. The closest algal relative of
    land plants is Characeae, and this relationship is well supported. Several
    methodological issues on reconstructing large, deep phylogenies are also
    discussed.

    A taxonomic study of megaspores with bifurcate-tipped processes from the
    Devonian-Carboniferous transition of Bolivia was performed. Megaspore
    specimens were isolated from palynological samples of the Pando X1 and
    Manuripi X1 boreholes. Their morphological characteristics and wall
    structures were described and illustrated with transmitted optical light,
    ultraviolet fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. This megaspore
    assemblage comprised six fossil species of Hystricosporites (H. costatus, H.
    delectabilis, H. elongatus, H. expandus, H. furcatus and H. spiralis). The
    morphologic features of their sporoderms confirm that these megaspores with
    bifurcate-tipped processes could have had a botanical affinity related to
    lycopsids. Additional future studies of wall ultrastructure using
    transmission electron microscopy will provide more information about their
    phylogenetic relationships with fossil and extant lycopsids.

    Genetic evidence from enzyme electrophoresis and restriction site analyses
    of cpDNA was employed to explore the origin of the tetraploid Hemionitis
    pinnatifida by determining the role of diploid species of Hemionitis in
    contributing to the tetraploid genome. The results clearly supported the
    hypothesis that H. pinnatifida is an allotetraploid with H. palmata as one
    of its diploid progenitors. The other diploid parent was not identified
    among the existing species of Hemionitis and is either extinct or
    exceedingly rare. Genetic identity analyses compared the extant diploid
    genomes with the divergent diploid genomes combined in tetraploids. One of
    these divergent genomes was shown to be a good approximation of that of H.
    palmata, and the other is a reconstruction of that of the missing diploid
    parent. These analyses demonstrated that the missing ancestor was
    genetically more similar to H. palmata than either of these species is to
    the other diploid species surveyed. Such greater genetic similarity may have
    been important in allowing hybridization between the two diploid progenitors
    of H. pinnatifida. The data also suggest that tetraploid individuals may
    have been synthesized de novo at least five times among the three
    populations surveyed.

    Historical biogeography of Asplenium adiantum-nigrum (Aspleniaceae) in North

  type: article-journal

  abstract: >-
    The vascular-plant flora of the Hawaiian Islands is characterized by one of
    the highest rates of species endemism in the world. Among flowering plants,
    approximately 89&#37; of species are endemic, and among pteridophytes, about
    76&#37; are endemic. At the single-island level, however, rates of species
    endemism vary dramatically between these two groups with 80&#37; of
    angiosperms and only 6&#37; of pteridophytes being single-island endemics.
    Thus, in many groups of Hawaiian angiosperms, it is possible to link studies
    of phylogeny, evolution, and biogeographic history at the interspecific and
    interisland levels. In contrast, the low level of single-island species
    endemism among Hawaiian pteridophytes makes similar interspecific and
    interisland studies nearly impossible. Higher levels of interisland gene
    flow may account for the different levels of single-island endemism in
    Hawaiian pteridophytes relative to angiosperms. The primary question we
    addressed in the present study was: Can we infer microevolutionary patterns
    and processes among populations within widespread species of Hawaiian
    pteridophytes wherein gene flow is probably common? To address this broad
    question, we conducted a population genetic study of the native Hawaiian
    colonizing species Odontosoria chinensis. Data from allozyme analyses
    allowed us to infer: (1) significant genetic differentiation among
    populations from different islands; (2) historical patterns of dispersal
    between particular pairs of islands; (3) archipelago-level patterns of
    dispersal and colonization; (4) founder effects among populations on the
    youngest island of Hawaii; and, (5) that this species primarily reproduces
    via outcrossing, but may possess a mixed-mating system. Corresponding

    A previous study examined the sexual expression of cultured gametophytes of
    the Hawaiian endemics Sadleria cyatheoides and S. pallida grown on
    mineral-enriched agar. In the present work, we conducted ﬁeld studies on the
    sexual expression of natural populations of Sadleria spp. gametophytes. Our
    primary goal was to compare ﬁeld-collected data to the laboratory-based data
    of the earlier study to assess if the laboratory data were an accurate
    reﬂection of what is occurring in nature. Our results suggested that for
    generally inferring mating systems operating in nature, agar-based
    laboratory studies of gametophytes lead to the same conclusions as would
    observations of ﬁeld-collected gametophytes. For detailed studies of
    gametophyte sexuality and development, however, an agar-based medium
    produces signiﬁcantly different results than what is found among natural
    populations, although this may be true for any lab-based study regardless of
    growth medium. Thus, we suggest caution in the use of agar as a growth
    medium, and the use of laboratory conditions in general, for studies of fern
    gametophyte sexual development.

  abstract: >-
    In this correlated SEM (scanning electron microscope) and TEM (transmission
    electron microscope) investigation, we describe architectural details of the
    multiflagellated sperm cell of Psilotum nudum. Comparisons with other
    pteridophytes are made to (1) assess the placement of Psilotum among
    pteridophyte taxa and (2) evaluate structural modifications of sperm cells
    during land plant evolution. The released spermatozoid of Psilotum coils 2.0
    revolutions and is outlined by a parallel band of up to 190 microtubules.
    The elongated nucleus is highly compacted and parallels the cellular coils
    with numerous mitochondria and starch-laden plastids distributed along its
    length. Along the anterior coil is an elaborate locomotory apparatus that
    includes ∼36 flagella that are inserted into the cell by basal bodies.
    Subtending the basal bodies is the multilayered structure, which consists of
    a long narrow lamellar strip and an overlying band of microtubules. An
    elongated anterior mitochondrion underlies the multilayered structure.
    Additional amyloplasts and mitochondria are aggregated along the anterior
    coil in association with the locomotory apparatus, while a fibrous band
    encircles the leading edge of the cell. Salient features of this cell,
    including details of the locomotory apparatus, structure and position of
    organelles, and arrangement of the spline, are shared by spermatozoids of
    Equisetum and ferns (including eusporangiate and leptosporangiate taxa).
    Thus, this study provides morphological support for the hypothesis that
    Psilotum nudum is a member of an assemblage that includes ferns and
    Equisetum. However, the less streamlined architecture of Psilotum gametes
    and the lack of architectural features shared with any specific taxon
    examined to date suggest that Psilotum is an early divergent fern, with
    relatively remote affinities to Ophioglossaceae and Equisetaceae.

    Background and Aims: The group of pteridophytes and lycophytes has been
    understudied in Honduras, which can be observed in the Río Plátano Man and
    Biosphere Reserve (RPHBR) that only has 44 species reported. The objec ve of
    this study is to present a preliminary list of these groups, coun ng the
    species found in archaeological sites within the department of Gracias a
    Dios and presen ng four new records for the  ora of Honduras. Methods: As
    part of  oris c inventories realized between August 2016 and September 2017,
    a total of 58 species of pteridophytes and lycophytes not previously
    reported for the RPHBR were collected and iden  ed in the municipality of
    Brus Laguna, the species names were updated, and the species present in the
    protected area were cataloged. Key results: The ferns reported for the RPHBR
    increased to 103 species, which represents an increase of 131% and three new
    records of the genus Tectaria and one of Adiantum are added for Honduras.
    Conclusions: The diversity of these groups stands out in li le altered areas
    within the RPHBR, especially along the rivers. However, there is also a lack
    of informa on in the areas close to the towns, that are currently altered
    and need protec on and research. Key words: Adiantum humile, inventory,
    Tectaria athyrioides, Tectaria rufovillosa, Tectaria subebenea.

    ABSTRACT Pteris multifida Poir. occurs in many tropical, subtropical, and
    temperate regions of the world. Because it is widely cultivated, populations
    have escaped from gardens and naturalized in many regions, including in the
    United States. In California, P. multifida was first collected in 1942
    growing outside of cultivation in the San Gabriel Mountains, Los Angeles
    County. It was reported by GN Jones in 1955, but otherwise it has been
    omitted ...

    The floating fern Salvinia molesta D. S. Mitchell (Salviniaceae) originated
    in southeastern Brazil1, but since about 1930, it has been introduced into
    various tropical and subtropical regions where it has become as great a
    menace as the water hyacinth2-4. Biological control of salvinia has clear
    economic and environmental advantages over other methods of control, but
    earlier attempts either failed or achieved inconclusive results5-7. We
    report here successful control of the largest salvinia infestation in
    Australia using the beetle Cyrtobagous singularis Hustache(Curculionidae)
    and suggest why this beetle has potential for controlling salvinia
    infestations elsewhere. © 1981 Nature Publishing Group.

    Cheilanthoid ferns (Pteridaceae) are a diverse and ecologically important
    clade, unusual among ferns for their ability to colonize and diversify
    within xeric habitats. These extreme habitats are thought to drive the
    extensive evolutionary convergence, and thus morphological homoplasy, that
    has long thwarted a natural classification of cheilanthoid ferns. Here we
    present the first multigene phylogeny to focus on taxa traditionally
    assigned to the large genus Notholaena. New World taxa (Notholaena sensu
    Tryon) are only distantly related to species occurring in the Old World
    (Notholaena sensu Pichi Sermolli). The circumscription of Notholaena adopted
    in recent American floras is shown to be paraphyletic, with species usually
    assigned to Cheilanthes and Cheiloplecton nested within it. The position of
    Cheiloplecton is particularly surprising - given its well-developed false
    indusium and non-farinose blade, it is morphologically anomalous within the
    "notholaenoids". In addition to clarifying natural relationships, the
    phylogenetic hypothesis presented here helps to resolve outstanding
    nomenclatural issues and provides a basis for examining character evolution
    within this diverse, desert-adapted clade.

    Backbone relationships within the large eupolypod II clade, which includes
    nearly a third of extant fern species, have resisted elucidation by both
    molecular and morphological data. Earlier studies suggest that much of the
    phylogenetic intractability of this group is due to three factors: (i) a
    long root that reduces apparent levels of support in the ingroup; (ii) long
    ingroup branches subtended by a series of very short backbone internodes
    (the "ancient rapid radiation" model); and (iii) significantly heterogeneous
    lineage-specific rates of substitution. To resolve the eupolypod II
    phylogeny, with a particular emphasis on the backbone internodes, we
    assembled a data set of five plastid loci (atpA, atpB, matK, rbcL, and
    trnG-R) from a sample of 81 accessions selected to capture the deepest
    divergences in the clade. We then evaluated our phylogenetic hypothesis
    against potential confounding factors, including those induced by rooting,
    ancient rapid radiation, rate heterogeneity, and the Bayesian star-tree
    paradox artifact. While the strong support we inferred for the backbone
    relationships proved robust to these potential problems, their investigation
    revealed unexpected model-mediated impacts of outgroup composition,
    divergent effects of methods for countering the star-tree paradox artifact,
    and gave no support to concerns about the applicability of the unrooted
    model to data sets with heterogeneous lineage-specific rates of
    substitution. This study is among few to investigate these factors with
    empirical data, and the first to compare the performance of the two primary
    methods for overcoming the Bayesian star-tree paradox artifact. Among the
    significant phylogenetic results is the near-complete support along the
    eupolypod II backbone, the demonstrated paraphyly of Woodsiaceae as
    currently circumscribed, and the well-supported placement of the enigmatic
    genera Homalosorus, Diplaziopsis, and Woodsia. © 2012 The Author(s).

    We present a family-level classification for the eupolypod II clade of
    leptosporangiate ferns, one of the two major lineages within the Eupolypods,
    and one of the few parts of the fern tree of life where family-level
    relationships were not well understood at the time of publication of the
    2006 fern classification by Smith & al. Comprising over 2500 species, the
    composition and particularly the relationships among the major clades of
    this group have historically been contentious and defied phylogenetic
    resolution until very recently. Our classification reflects the most current
    available data, largely derived from published molecular phylogenetic
    studies. In comparison with the five-family (Aspleniaceae, Blechnaceae,
    Onocleaceae, Thelypteridaceae, Woodsiaceae) treatment of Smith & al., we
    recognize 10 families within the eupolypod II clade. Of these, Aspleniaceae,
    Thelypteridaceae, Blechnaceae, and Onocleaceae have the same composition as
    treated by Smith & al. Woodsiaceae, which Smith & al. acknowledged as
    possibly non-monophyletic in their treatment, is circumscribed here to
    include only Woodsia and its segregates; the other "woodsioid" taxa are
    divided among Athyriaceae, Cystopteridaceae, Diplaziopsidaceae,
    Rhachidosoraceae, and Hemidictyaceae. We provide circumscriptions for each
    family, which summarize their morphological, geographical, and ecological
    characters, as well as a dichotomous key to the eupolypod II families. Three
    of these families- Diplaziopsidaceae, Hemidictyaceae, and
    Rhachidosoraceae-were described in the past year based on molecular
    phylogenetic analyses; we provide here their first morphological treatment.

    Among the novel results of recent molecular phylogenetic analyses are the
    unexpectedly close evolutionary relationships of the genera Acystopteris,
    Cystopteris, and Gymnocarpium, and the phylogenetic isolation of these
    genera from Woodsia. As a consequence, these three genera have been removed
    from Woodsiaceae and placed into their own family, the Cystopteridaceae.
    Despite the ubiquity of this family in rocky habitats across the northern
    hemisphere, and its cosmopolitan distribution (occurring on every continent
    except Antarctica), sampling of the Cystopteridaceae in phylogenetic studies
    to date has been sparse. Here we assemble a three-locus plastid dataset
    (matK, rbcL, trnG-R) that includes most recognized species in the family and
    multiple accessions of widespread taxa from across their geographic ranges.
    All three sampled genera are robustly supported as monophyletic, Cystopteris
    is strongly supported as sister to Acystopteris, and those two genera
    together are sister to Gymnocarpium. The Gymnocarpium phylogeny is deeply
    divided into three major clades, which we label the disjunctum clade, the
    robertianum clade, and core Gymnocarpium. The Cystopteris phylogeny,
    similarly, features four deeply diverged clades: C. montana, the sudetica
    clade, the bulbifera clade, and the fragilis complex. Acystopteris includes
    only three species, each of which is supported as monophyletic, with A.
    taiwaniana sister to the japonica/tenuisecta clade. Our results yield the
    first species-level phylogeny of the Cystopteridaceae and the first
    molecular phylogenetic evidence for species boundaries. These data provide
    an essential foundation for further investigations of complex patterns of
    geographic diversification, speciation, and reticulation in this family. ©

    Background:Molecular phylogenetic investigations have revolutionized our
    understanding of the evolutionary history of ferns-the second-most
    species-rich major group of vascular plants, and the sister clade to seed
    plants. The general absence of genomic resources available for this
    important group of plants, however, has resulted in the strong dependence of
    these studies on plastid data; nuclear or mitochondrial data have been
    rarely used. In this study, we utilize transcriptome data to design primers
    for nuclear markers for use in studies of fern evolutionary biology, and
    demonstrate the utility of these markers across the largest order of ferns,
    the Polypodiales.Principal Findings:We present 20 novel single-copy nuclear
    regions, across 10 distinct protein-coding genes: ApPEFP_C, cryptochrome 2,
    cryptochrome 4, DET1, gapCpSh, IBR3, pgiC, SQD1, TPLATE, and transducin.
    These loci, individually and in combination, show strong resolving power
    across the Polypodiales phylogeny, and are readily amplified and sequenced
    from our genomic DNA test set (from 15 diploid Polypodiales species). For
    each region, we also present transcriptome alignments of the focal locus and
    related paralogs-curated broadly across ferns-that will allow researchers to
    develop their own primer sets for fern taxa outside of the Polypodiales.
    Analyses of sequence data generated from our genomic DNA test set reveal
    strong effects of partitioning schemes on support levels and, to a much
    lesser extent, on topology. A model partitioned by codon position is
    strongly favored, and analyses of the combined data yield a Polypodiales
    phylogeny that is well-supported and consistent with earlier studies of this
    group.Conclusions:The 20 single-copy regions presented here more than triple
    the single-copy nuclear regions available for use in ferns. They provide a
    much-needed opportunity to assess plastid-derived hypotheses of
    relationships within the ferns, and increase our capacity to explore aspects
    of fern evolution previously unavailable to scientific investigation. © 2013

    Molecular evolutionary rate heterogeneity-the violation of a molecular
    clock-is a prominent feature of many phylogenetic data sets. It has
    particular importance to systematists not only because of its biological
    implications, but also for its practical effects on our ability to infer and
    date evolutionary events. Here we show, using both maximum likelihood and
    Bayesian approaches, that a remarkably strong increase in substitution rate
    in the vittarioid ferns is consistent across the nuclear and plastid
    genomes. Contrary to some expectations, this rate increase is not due to
    selective forces acting at the protein level on our focal loci. The
    vittarioids bear no signature of the change in the relative strengths of
    selection and drift that one would expect if the rate increase was caused by
    altered post-mutation fixation rates. Instead, the substitution rate
    increase appears to stem from an elevated supply of mutations, perhaps
    limited to the vittarioid ancestral branch. This generalized rate increase
    is accompanied by extensive fine-scale heterogeneity in rates across loci,
    genomes, and taxa. Our analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and
    flexibility of trait-free investigations of rate heterogeneity within a
    model-selection framework, emphasize the importance of explicit tests for
    signatures of selection prior to invoking selection-related or
    demography-based explanations for patterns of rate variation, and illustrate
    some unexpected nuances in the behavior of relaxed clock methods for
    modeling rate heterogeneity, with implications for our ability to
    confidently date divergence events. In addition, our data provide strong
    support for the monophyly of Adiantum, and for the position of
    Calciphilopteris in the cheilanthoid ferns, two relationships for which
    convincing support was previously lacking. © 2013 The Author(s).

    © International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) 2014. Here we present
    the first nuclear phylogeny for Cystopteridaceae (Polypodiales), using the
    single-copy locus gapCp “short”. This phylogeny corroborates broad results
    from plastid data in demonstrating strong support for the monophyly of the
    family’s three genera—Cystopteris, Acystopteris, and Gymnocarpium—and of the
    major groups within Cystopteris (C. montana, the sudetica and bulbifera
    clades, and the C. fragilis complex). In addition, it confirms the rampant
    hybridization (allopolyploidy) that has long been suspected within both
    Cystopteris and Gymnocarpium. In some cases, these data provide the first
    DNA-sequence-based evidence for previous hypotheses of polyploid species
    origins (such as the cosmopolitan G. dryopteris being an allotetraploid
    derivative of the diploids G. appalachianum and G. disjunctum). Most of the
    allopolyploids, however, have no formal taxonomic names. This pattern is
    particularly strong within the C. fragilis complex, where our results imply
    that the eight included accessions of “C. fragilis” represent at least six
    distinct allopolyploid taxa.

    © 2015 Botanical Society of America. PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Understanding
    fern (monilophyte) phylogeny and its evolutionary timescale is critical for
    broad investigations of the evolution of land plants, and for providing the
    point of comparison necessary for studying the evolution of the fern sister
    group, seed plants. Molecular phylogenetic investigations have
    revolutionized our understanding of fern phylogeny, however, to date, these
    studies have relied almost exclusively on plastid data. METHODS: Here we
    take a curated phylogenomics approach to infer the fi rst broad fern
    phylogeny from multiple nuclear loci, by combining broad taxon sampling (73
    ferns and 12 outgroup species) with focused character sampling (25 loci
    comprising 35 877 bp), along with rigorous alignment, orthology inference
    and model selection. KEY RESULTS: Our phylogeny corroborates some earlier
    inferences and provides novel insights; in particular, we fi nd strong
    support for Equisetales as sister to the rest of ferns, Marattiales as
    sister to leptosporangiate ferns, and Dennstaedtiaceae as sister to the
    eupolypods. Our divergence-time analyses reveal that divergences among the
    extant fern orders all occurred prior to ~200 MYA. Finally, our species-tree
    inferences are congruent with analyses of concatenated data, but generally
    with lower support. Those cases where species-tree support values are higher
    than expected involve relationships that have been supported by smaller
    plastid datasets, suggesting that deep coalescence may be reducing support
    from the concatenated nuclear data. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the
    utility of a curated phylogenomics approach to inferring fern phylogeny, and
    highlights the need to consider underlying data characteristics, along with
    data quantity, in phylogenetic studies.

    © 2015 by The University of Chicago. A fern from the French
    Pyrenees-XCystocarpium roskamianum-is a recently formed intergeneric hybrid
    between parental lineages that diverged from each other approximately 60
    million years ago (mya; 95% highest posterior density: 40.2-76.2 mya). This
    is an extraordinarily deep hybridization event, roughly akin to an elephant
    hybridizing with a manatee or a human with a lemur. In the context of other
    reported deep hybrids, this finding suggests that populations of ferns, and
    other plants with abiotically mediated fertilization, may evolve
    reproductive incompatibilities more slowly, perhaps because they lack many
    of the premating isolation mechanisms that characterize most other groups of
    organisms. This conclusion implies that major features of Earth’s
    biodiversity-such as the relatively small number of species of ferns
    compared to those of angiosperms-may be, in part, an indirect by-product of
    this slower “speciation clock” rather than a direct consequence of adaptive
    innovations by the more diverse lineages.

    Difficulties in generating nuclear data for polyploids have impeded
    phylogenetic study of these groups. We describe a high-throughput protocol
    and an associated bioinformatics pipeline (Pipeline for Untangling
    Reticulate Complexes (Purc)) that is able to generate these data quickly and
    conveniently, and demonstrate its efficacy on accessions from the fern
    family Cystopteridaceae. We conclude with a demonstration of the downstream
    utility of these data by inferring a multi-labeled species tree for a subset
    of our accessions. We amplified four c. 1-kb-long nuclear loci and sequenced
    them in a parallel-tagged amplicon sequencing approach using the PacBio
    platform. Purc infers the final sequences from the raw reads via an
    iterative approach that corrects PCR and sequencing errors and removes
    PCR-mediated recombinant sequences (chimeras). We generated data for all
    gene copies (homeologs, paralogs, and segregating alleles) present in each
    of three sets of 50 mostly polyploid accessions, for four loci, in three
    PacBio runs (one run per set). From the raw sequencing reads, Purc was able
    to accurately infer the underlying sequences. This approach makes it easy
    and economical to study the phylogenetics of polyploids, and, in conjunction
    with recent analytical advances, facilitates investigation of broad patterns
    of polyploid evolution.

    Premise: Pteridophytes—vascular land plants that disperse by spores—are a
    powerful system for studying plant evolution, particularly with respect to
    the impact of abiotic factors on evolutionary trajectories through deep
    time. However, our ability to use pteridophytes to investigate such
    questions—or to capitalize on the ecological and conservation‐related
    applications of the group—has been impaired by the relative isolation of the
    neo‐ and paleobotanical research communities and by the absence of
    large‐scale biodiversity data sources.

    Vegetative and fertile frond segments of Botrychium have been recovered from
    Paleocene deposits of central Alberta, Canada. Specimens are preserved as
    coalified compressions that yield information about frond structure,
    sporangia, and spore ultrastructure. These fossils, described as Botrychium
    wightonii sp. nov., establish a megafossil record for the Ophioglossales,
    and demonstrate that modem-appearing species of the order were present in
    western North America by the earliest Tertiary. The largest vegetative
    fragments are up to 4.6 em long and tripinnately compound, with opposite to
    subopposite branching. Ultimate segments are pinnatifid with dentate
    pinnules and open dichotomous venation. Fertile specimens are also
    tripinnately compound with a long rachis and subopposite to alternate
    pinnae. Sporangia are either submarginal and superficial, or marginal, and
    are all directed toward one surface of the pinnule. They are ovoid to
    subspheroidal and 0.8-2.0 mm in diameter. Some sporangia are apparently
    stalked, while others appear to be sessile. This variation results both from
    the ultimate frond segments being compressed in several different planes,
    and the fossils being exposed at different levels. Spores macerated from the
    sporangia are radial and trilete, and range 30-67 /Lm in diameter. Most are
    psilate, but some have a densely striate surface.

    We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the fern genus Elaphoglossum using
    two non-coding chloroplast spacers: trnL-trnF and rps4-trnS. The sampling
    includes 123 species, of which 80 have not been previously sequenced, and
    for the ﬁrst time includes species from Africa and the Indian Ocean area.
    The results of this expanded study largely agree with an earlier molecular
    study based on a smaller group of neotropical species and with the
    morphology-based classiﬁcation of Mickel and Atehortu´ a. We found, however,
    that some infrageneric groups such as section Elaphoglossum are not
    monophyletic. Besides section Elaphoglossum pro parte, we recognize six
    sections: two new monospeciﬁc, unnamed sections, and the previously
    established sections Lepidoglossa, Squamipedia, Amygdalifolia, and
    ‘‘Subulate-scaled clade.’’ We divide the subulate-scaled clade into
    subsection Setosa (hydathodes present) and Polytrichia (hydathodes absent),
    and section Elaphoglossum is divided into subsections Platyglossa and
    Pachyglossa, two groups that do not appear to be supported by any single
    morphological character. In general, however, the main clades are supported
    by morphology. Finally, we discuss the species of the Indian Ocean region
    and their aﬃnities with the neotropical ones. Out of the 11 species pairs
    postulated by Moran and Smith on the basis of morphology, two are well
    supported (E. eximium–E. aubertii; E. piloselloides–E. spatulatum) and three
    are not supported (E. ciliatum–E. humbertii; E. muscosum–E. poolii; E.
    paleaceum–E. deckenii), and two remain unresolved (E. erinaceum–E. hybridum;
    E. glabellum–E. acrostichoides) because our molecular markers were not
    variable enough. Four species pairs could not be tested because specimens
    were lacking. Unsupported species pairs are best interpreted as
    morphological convergences. Two additional species pairs are proposed: E.
    cuspidatum–E. succisaefolium; E. doanense–E. hornei. Placement of the
    species from the Indian Ocean suggests that at least 13 long-distance
    dispersal events occurred between the Neotropics and the Indian
    Ocean-Africa.

    Polypodium s.s. is currently a fern genus with about 40 species, and still
    with a controversial circumscription. The Flora of Brazil online reports
    just one Polypodium species in Brazil. Here we confirm the occurrence of a
    second species of the genus in Brazil, and present a taxonomic treatment of
    Polypodium from this country; this includes descriptions, an identification
    key, diagnostic illustrations, and comments on the species. The genus is
    represented in Brazil by two species: Polypodium flagellare and P. kunzeanum
    . In addition, a lectotypification is proposed.

  abstract: >-
    Thirteen genera are traditionally recognized in the subfamily
    Taenitidoideae, Pteridaceae. A phylogenetic study of this subfamily, based
    on both morphological and molecular data, was performed using an exemplar
    approach. Representatives of the following genera were included in the
    analyses: Jamesonia, Eriosorus, Pterozonium, Syngramma, Taenitis,
    Austrogramme, Pityrogramma, Anogramma, Actiniopteris, Onychium, and
    Afropteris. Specimens and DNA samples were not available for Cerosora and
    Nephopteris, so they were excluded. Three species were chosen as outgroups:
    Pteris multifida, P. quadriaurita, and Coniogramme fraxinea, all of which
    are restricted to the Old World. A robust phylogeny was generated based on
    26 morphological characters, 578 base pairs of the plastid gene rps4 and
    partial data from the intergenic spacer rps4-trnS. The results reject the
    hypothesis of monophyly of the subfamily as presented by Tryon et al.
    (1990). However, the results support the monophyly of a well-supported clade
    consisting of Jamesonia, Eriosorus, Pterozonium, Austrogramme, Syngramma,
    Taenitis, Pityrogramma, and Anogramma. The New World genera Jamesonia and
    Eriosorus form a monophyletic group, and Pterozonium is more closely related
    to the Old World genera, Austrogramme, Syngramma, and Taenitis.

  abstract: >-
    During herbarium studies for the Flora of Cuba, a new species was found,
    Parapolystichum villosissimum, which is here described. The species is
    endemic to Cuba and known from only four collections from the mountain
    ranges of southeastern Cuba. The last specimen collected was made over 90
    years ago. Recent efforts to relocate this species were unsuccessful,
    suggesting that it should be treated as threatened. The new species is
    described, illustrated, and compared to the most similar species. A key to
    the Neotropical species of Parapolystichum is also provided.

  abstract: >-
    Nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast gene rbcL from 42 species of the
    fern tribe Physematieae (Dryopteridaceae) were analyzed to gain insights
    into the inter- and intrageneric relationships and the generic
    circumscriptions in the tribe. The phylogenetic relationships were inferred
    using the neighbor-joining and maximum-parsimony methods, and both methods
    produced largely congruent trees. These trees reveal that: (1) Athyrium,
    Cornopteris, Pseudocystopteris, and Anisocampium form a clade and Athyrium
    is polyphyletic; (2) Deparia sensu lato is monophyletic and Dictyodroma
    formosana is included in the Deparia clade; (3) Diplaziopsis forms a clade
    with Homalosorus, which is isolated from the other genera of the
    Physematieae; (4) Monomelangium is included in the monophyletic Diplazium
    clade; and (5) Rhachidosorus is not closely related to either Athyrium or
    Diplazium.

    This paper analyses aquatic ferns from the genera Azolla Lam., Marsilea L.
    and Salvinia Séguier, which occur in the Danube Delta, Romania, and
    comprises a series of anatomical and histological observations of
    taxonomical, chorological and eco-morphological importance. The research
    conducted on specimens collected between 2005-2013 from the natural habitats
    of the Danube Delta, but also from the extra-deltaic artificial habitats
    have enabled: i) a reconsideration of some chorological aspects regarding
    the species of the genus Azolla in Romania; ii) a greater understanding of
    the adaptive plasticity relative to the factor water for the taxon Marsilea
    quadrifolia L. collected from natural and artificial habitats; iii) the
    enrichment of the data regarding the structural characteristics of the taxon
    Salvinia natans (L.) All., particularly around the adaptive elements
    associated with living on the surface of the water.

    Spores of the aquatic heterosporous fern family Marsileaceae differ markedly
    from spores of Salviniaceae, the only other family of heterosporous ferns
    and sister group to Marsileaceae, and from spores of all homosporous ferns.
    The marsileaceous outer spore wall (perine) is modified above the aperture
    into a structure, the acrolamella, and the perine and acrolamella are
    further modified into a remarkable gelatinous layer that envelops the spore.
    Observations with light and scanning electron microscopy indicate that the
    three living marsileaceous fern genera (Marsilea, Pilularia, and
    Regnellidium) each have distinctive spores, particularly with regard to the
    perine and acrolamella. Several spore characters support a division of
    Marsilea into two groups. Spore character evolution is discussed in the
    context of developmental and possible functional aspects. The gelatinous
    perine layer acts as a flexible, floating organ that envelops the spores
    only for a short time and appears to be an adaptation of marsileaceous ferns
    to amphibious habitats. The gelatinous nature of the perine layer is likely
    the result of acidic polysaccharide components in the spore wall that have
    hydrogel (swelling and shrinking) properties. Megaspores floating at the
    water/air interface form a concave meniscus, at the center of which is the
    gelatinous acrolamella that encloses a "sperm lake." This meniscus creates a
    vortex-like effect that serves as a trap for free-swimming sperm cells,
    propelling them into the sperm lake.

  abstract: >-
    We explore the phylogeny of the polygrammoid ferns using nucleotide
    sequences derived from three plastid loci for each of 98 selected species.
    Our analyses recovered four major monophyletic lineages: the loxogrammoids,
    two clades consisting of taxa restricted to the Old World, and a largely
    neotropical clade that also includes the pantropical Grammitidaceae. The
    loxogrammoid lineage diverges first and is sister to a large clade
    comprising the three remaining species-rich lineages. One paleotropical
    clade includes the drynarioid and selligueoid ferns, whereas the second
    paleotropical clade includes the platycerioids, lepisoroids, microsoroids,
    and their relatives. The grammitids nest within the neotropical clade,
    although the sister taxon of this circum-tropic, epiphytic group remains
    ambiguous. Microsorum and Polypodium, as traditionally defined, were
    recovered as polyphyletic. The relatively short branch lengths of the
    deepest clades contrast with the long branch lengths leading to the terminal
    groups. This suggests that the polygrammoid ferns arose through an old,
    rapid radiation. Our analysis also reveals that the rate of substitution in
    the grammitids is remarkably higher relative to other polygrammoids.
    Disparities in substitution rate may be correlated with one or more features
    characterizing grammitids, including species richness, chlorophyllous
    spores, and an extended gametophytic phase. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All

    Identification of fern gametophytes is generally hampered by low
    morphological complexity. Here we explore an alternative: DNA-based
    identification. We obtained a plastid rbcL sequence from a sterile
    gametophyte of unknown origin (cultivated for more than 30 years) and
    employed BLAST to determine its affinities. Using this approach, we
    identified the gametophyte as Osmunda regalis. To evaluate the robustness of
    this determination, and the usefulness of rbcL in differentiating among
    species, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of osmundaceous fern
    sequences. Based on our results, it is evident that DNA-based identification
    has considerable potential in exploring the ecology of fern gametophytes.

    Polyploidy is widely considered as a major process in the evolution of
    plants but the accumulation of polyploid species diversity is still
    controversial. Some recent studies proposed increased extinction risk in
    neopolyploids compared with their diploid ancestors. The high proportion of
    polyploid ferns is expected to be formed mainly by neopolyploids, whereas
    paleopolyploid species are predicted to be clustered in clades founded by
    whole genome duplications. Here, we test this prediction by exploring the
    evolution of polyploidy in the derived fern family Aspleniaceae. The family
    has a global distribution and shows the highest frequency of polyploid taxa
    among all ferns. To test the hypothesis, we obtained a comprehensive
    phylogeny using chloroplast DNA sequences of 883 specimens representing 292
    species. All published chromosome counts were mapped onto this phylogenetic
    framework in order to explore the evolution of polyploids. We recovered
    evidence for several whole genome duplications in the history of
    Aspleniaceae. Phylogenetic relationships of polyploids exceeding the
    tetraploid level suggest that tetraploid Asplenium species may have replaced
    their diploid ancestors as the main evolutionary players in some clades of
    this family.

    In Europe Athyrium filix-femina has a constant chromosome  number (2n = 80)
    and is sexual. The normal type of reproduction is inter-  gametophytic
    crossing. In the gametophyte phase there is a hormone system  which induces
    dark germination of spores and antheridium formation. Sporo-  phytes
    originating from single prothalli show that a genetic load is present in
    all  population examined. It appears not to be a simple allelic load but a 
    complicated balanced system. Morphological variability can be interpreted
    as  the expression of the genetic heterogeneity of populations. There are
    no  crossing barriers, not even between insular populations hundreds of
    kilometers  apart.

    This paper deals with a detailed investigation of the sorus development in
    Adiantum raddianum against the background of the ontogenesis of the
    sporophyll. During the phase of pinnae laminae formation the sorus is formed
    on the underside of a recurved pinna lobe subblastozonally very close to the
    former leaf marginal initials. The first sporangia are initiated before the
    leaf veins enter the developing receptacle. During the elongational growth
    of the sorus-bearing pinna lobe, its former marginal blastozone develops a
    membranous flap as an additional structure. Because its position has nothing
    in common with a blastozone portion, the membranous flap can only be
    classified as an appendage. Some results of this study are discussed in an
    evolutionary context.

    The ancient divergence between the lycopsid genus Isoetes and its closest
    living relative (Selaginella) has resulted in considerable morphological and
    genetic disparity, yet within Isoetes there is remarkable morphological and
    genetic uniformity. This has made it difficult to identify the phylogenetic
    root of the genus. In this study, we addressed this problem and
    characterized the early branching patterns within Isoetes using an expanded
    set of taxa and three molecular markers. We assessed the saturation in the
    molecular data sets, tested for differences in evolutionary rate, determined
    the stability of the ingroup topology, and evaluated the applicability of
    the molecular clock. We then explored three alternative rooting approaches:
    outgroup, midpoint, and maximum likelihood under the assumption of a
    molecular clock. Attempts to infer the root of Isoetes using the outgroup
    approach were severely hindered by the effects of saturation, but the
    results from midpoint rooting and the enforcement of the molecular clock
    were highly consistent among the data sets. We identify the root of Isoetes
    to be located among three major, highly supported clades.

    DNA sequence data and phylogenetic approaches have contributed greatly to
    our understanding of fern relationships. Nonetheless, the datasets analyzed
    to date have not been sufficient to definitively resolve all parts of the
    global fern phylogeny; additional data and more extensive sampling are
    necessary. Here, we explore the phylogenetic utility of the plastid atpA
    gene. Using newly designed primers, we obtained atpA sequences for 52 fern
    and 6 outgroup taxa, and then evaluated the capabilities of atpA relative to
    four other molecular markers, as well as the contributions of atpA in
    combined analyses. The five single-gene datasets differed markedly in the
    number of variable characters they possessed; and although the relationships
    resolved in analyses of these datasets were largely congruent, the
    robustness of the hypotheses varied considerably. The atpA dataset had more
    variable characters and resulted in a more robustly supported phylogeny than
    any of the other single gene datasets examined, suggesting that atpA will be
    exceptionally useful in more extensive studies of fern phylogeny and perhaps
    also in studies of other plant lineages. When the atpA data were analyzed in
    combination with the other four markers, an especially robust hypothesis of
    fern relationships emerged. With the addition of the atpA data, support
    increased substantially at several nodes; three nodes, which were not
    well-supported previously, received both good posterior probability and good
    bootstrap support in the combined 5-gene (> 6 kb) analyses.

    The rate of molecular evolution is not constant across the Tree of Life.
    Characterizing rate discrepancies and evaluating the relative roles of time
    and rate along branches through the past are both critical to a full
    understanding of evolutionary history. In this study, we explore the
    interactions of time and rate in filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae), a lineage
    with extreme branch length differences between the two major clades. We test
    for the presence of significant rate discrepancies within and between these
    clades, and we separate time and rate across the filmy fern phylogeny to
    simultaneously yield an evolutionary time scale of filmy fern
    diversification and reconstructions of ancestral rates of molecular
    evolution. Our results indicate that the branch length disparity observed
    between the major lineages of filmy ferns is indeed due to a significant
    difference in molecular evolutionary rate. The estimation of divergence
    times reveals that the timing of crown group diversification was not
    concurrent for the two lineages, and the reconstruction of ancestral rates
    of molecular evolution points to a substantial rate deceleration in one of
    the clades. Further analysis suggests that this may be due to a genome-wide
    deceleration in the rate of nucleotide substitution. [Bayesian analysis;
    divergence time estimates; molecular clock; molecular rate heterogeneity;

    The monophyletic Pteridaceae accounts for roughly 10% of extant fern
    diversity and occupies an unusually broad range of ecological niches,
    including terrestrial, epiphytic, xeric-adapted rupestral, and even aquatic
    species. In this study, we present the results of the ﬁrst broad-scale and
    multi-gene phylogenetic analyses of these ferns, and determine the aﬃnities
    of several previously unsampled genera. Our analyses of two newly assembled
    data sets (including 169 newly obtained sequences) resolve ﬁve major clades
    within the Pteridaceae: cryptogrammoids, ceratopteridoids, pteridoids,
    adiantoids, and cheilanthoids. Although the composition of these clades is
    in general agreement with earlier phylogenetic studies, it is very much at
    odds with the most recent subfamilial classiﬁcation. Of the previously
    unsampled genera, two (Neurocallis and Ochropteris) are nested within the
    genus Pteris; two others (Monogramma and Rheopteris) are early diverging
    vittarioid ferns, with Monogramma resolved as polyphyletic; the last
    previously unsampled genus (Adiantopsis) occupies a rather derived position
    among cheilanthoids. Interestingly, some clades resolved within the
    Pteridaceae can be characterized by their ecological preferences, suggesting
    that the initial diversiﬁcation in this family was tied to ecological
    innovation and specialization. These processes may well be the basis for the
    diversity and success of the Pteridaceae today.

    In today's angiosperm-dominated terrestrial ecosystems, leptosporangiate
    ferns are truly exceptional-accounting for 80% of the approximate to 11,000
    nonflowering vascular plant species. Recent studies have shown that this
    remarkable diversity is mostly the result of a major leptosporangiate
    radiation beginning in the Cretaceous, following the rise of angiosperms.
    This pattern is suggestive of an ecological opportunistic response, with the
    proliferation of flowering plants across the landscape resulting in the
    formation of many new niches-both on forest floors and within forest
    canopies-into which leptosporangiate ferns could diversify. At present,
    one-third of leptosporangiate species grow as epiphytes in the canopies of
    angiosperm-dominated tropical rain forests. However, we know too little
    about the evolutionary history of epiphytic ferns to assess whether or not
    their diversification was in fact linked to the establishment of these
    forests, as would be predicted by the ecological opportunistic response
    hypothesis. Here we provide new insight into leptosporangiate
    diversification and the evolution of epiphytism by integrating a 400-taxon
    molecular dataset with an expanded set of fossil age constraints. We find
    evidence for a burst of fern diversification in the Cenozoic, apparently
    driven by the evolution of epiphytism. Whether this explosive radiation was
    triggered simply by the establishment of modern angiosperm-dominated
    tropical rain forest canopies, or spurred on by some other large-scale
    extrinsic factor (e. g., climate change) remains to be determined. In either
    case, it is clear that in both the Cretaceous and Cenozoic, leptosporangiate
    ferns were adept at exploiting newly created niches in angiosperm-dominated
    ecosystems.

    Natural history collections contain data that are critical for many
    scientific endeavors. Recent efforts in mass digitization are generating
    large datasets from these collections that can provide unprecedented
    insight. Here, we present examples of how deep convolutional neural networks
    can be applied in analyses of imaged herbarium specimens. We first
    demonstrate that a convolutional neural network can detect mercury-stained
    specimens across a collection with 90% accuracy. We then show that such a
    network can correctly distinguish two morphologically similar plant families
    96% of the time. Discarding the most challenging specimen images increases
    accuracy to 94% and 99%, respectively. These results highlight the
    importance of mass digitization and deep learning approaches and reveal how
    they can together deliver powerful new investigative tools.

  abstract: >-
    The roughly 500 species of cheilanthoid ferns exhibit a diversity of
    morphological adaptations to xeric environments. However, most of these
    traits have evolved independently multiple times, impeding past efforts to
    establish a natural classification for the group. Considerable progress has
    been made over the past three decades resolving most of the major lineages,
    with the notable exception of the hemionitids, the largest and most widely
    distributed clade. The nearly 350 hemionitid species can be found in dry
    regions across the globe and account for two-thirds of cheilanthoid
    diversity. While some of the 17 genera commonly attributed to this group are
    easily recognized and demonstrably monophyletic, others have been shown to
    be clearly non-monophyletic. Here, we explore phylogenetic relationships
    among hemionitid species using a dataset that greatly expands on earlier
    studies. We carefully consider generic lines and propose a phylogenetically
    informed classification that better aligns with morphology, geography, and
    evolutionary history. Based on our analyses and morphological
    investigations, we propose the recognition of 22 monophyletic hemionitid
    genera. Nine of our generic circumscriptions are consistent with those of
    most other recent studies. Two other genera are expanded relative to these
    studies, while two are more narrowly defined. Two generic names are
    resurrected herein and seven genera are newly described to accommodate
    divergent clades. In all, 106 new species-level (plus 9 subspecific)
    combinations are made.

    - In Notholaena standleyi (Pteridaceae), differences in geographic range,
    aspect, height, edaphic requirements, and the color and chemistry of the
    ceraceous exudate on the abaxial side of the frond suggest at least three
    distinct subgroups of this taxon. One race, with a light yellow exudate
    consisting mostly of kaempferol, 3-O-methylkaempferol and
    4'-O-methylkaempferol occurs in the eastern portion of the range. A
    yellow-green race and a gold race possess mostly 7-O-methylkaempferol and
    4'-O-methylkaempferol but also the uncommon compounds 7-O-methylherbacetin
    and 7,4'-di-O-methylherbacetin. Plants of the yellow-green race produce
    minor constituents with methyl substituents in the 3-position whereas those
    of the gold race lack them. Plants of this last group produce only traces of
    kaempferol. Principal Components Analysis based on nine flavonoid
    constituents and 59 samples was carried out. Plants of the three groups
    clustered in plots of Principal Components 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, and 2 vs. 3 and
    were separated from each other. These plants reproduce ameiotically and thus
    there is little or no gene flow among them and they are geographically
    distinct. We prefer to maintain them as informally recognized taxa pending
    further studies.

  abstract: >-
    The fern flora of the Seychelles archipelago remains relatively poorly
    known. Current projects involving the development of the Seychelles National
    Herbarium and study of key biodiversity areas have resulted in extensive new
    explorations on the granitic islands. Historical literature, newly collected
    specimens and older collections have been revised for the fern family
    Marattiaceae as a prelude for a fern checklist, resulting in the rediscovery
    of Ptisana a century after it was last reported (as Marattia ). Two species
    of Angiopteris are recognised in the Seychelles, one of them new to science.
    In total, three species are recorded from the granitic Seychelles islands,
    Mahé and Silhouette, and none from the coral islands, which are too dry to
    harbour Marattiaceae. These three species are described in detail. The newly
    described Angiopteris chongsengiana is characterized by the elongated
    terminal pinnules and progressively reduced distal pairs of pinnules. Based
    on phylogenetic molecular analyses the Ptisana fraxinea complex is discussed
    and several new combinations are proposed. The Seychellois Ptisana is most
    closely related to Ascension Island endemic P. purpurascens and is described
    as a new species, Ptisana laboudalloniana . It differs from P. fraxinea in
    its winged secondary rachises and from P. salicifolia in its smaller habit,
    with the laminae shorter than broad and shorter than the petioles.
    Preliminary revisions of other fern families indicate that more discoveries
    are likely to be made in the fern flora of the Seychelles.

    © 2014 Sessa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. Ferns are the only major
    lineage of vascular plants not represented by a sequenced nuclear genome.
    This lack of genome sequence information significantly impedes our ability
    to understand and reconstruct genome evolution not only in ferns, but across
    all land plants. Azolla and Ceratopteris are ideal and complementary
    candidates to be the first ferns to have their nuclear genomes sequenced.
    They differ dramatically in genome size, life history, and habit, and thus
    represent the immense diversity of extant ferns. Together, this pair of
    genomes will facilitate myriad large-scale comparative analyses across ferns
    and all land plants. Here we review the unique biological characteristics of
    ferns and describe a number of outstanding questions in plant biology that
    will benefit from the addition of ferns to the set of taxa with sequenced
    nuclear genomes. We explain why the fern clade is pivotal for understanding
    genome evolution across land plants, and we provide a rationale for how
    knowledge of fern genomes will enable progress in research beyond the ferns
    themselves.

  abstract: >-
    Based on cpDNA data, we provide the phylogenetic position for 18 species of
    Neotropical grammitid ferns (Polypodiaceae) that were not previously
    included in a molecular phylogeny. These species were resolved in Alansmia,
    Ceradenia, Entero- sora, Grammitis, Lellingeria, Lomaphlebia, Melpomene,
    Moranopteris, Stenogrammitis, and Terpsichore. Our results indi- cate that
    Enterosora is polyphyletic and in need of generic recircumscription. We
    maintain the identity of Enterosora, based on the position of E. campbellii
    subsp. spongiosa, a variety of the type species. This finding allowed us to
    conclude that the E. parietina clade should be excluded from Enterosora. To
    accommodate this clade we describe a new genus, Parrisia. It is related to
    Adenophorus and a clade that includes Cochlidium, Grammitis s.s., and
    Lomaphlebia. We further found that Zygophlebia is paraphyletic with respect
    to Enterosora, represented by two separate clades, Zygophlebia s. s. that
    includes Z. cornuta, the type species, Z. sectifrons and Z. matthewsii, and
    a second clade that includes another seven species of Zygo- phlebia as well
    as E. barbatula. As a separate clade, this Zygophlebia species could be
    maintained. However, we prefer to sink both Zygophlebia clades into
    Enterosora. We propose ten novel combinations for Enterosora, by moving
    Zygophlebia with a confirmed phylogenetic position to Enterosora. It is
    possible that the remaining Zygophlebia species should also be treated as
    Enterosora, but further research is necessary.

    Petrifications of extinct pteridophytes are well known from the Upper
    Gondwana exposure especially from the Rajmahal Hills, Jharkhand, India.
    Anatomical studies of these ferns and fern allies have provided interesting
    information about the origin and evolution of stelar system and phylogenetic
    relationship. Systematic study of the petrified specimens includes
    Lycopodiales, Osmundales, Gleicheniales, Schizaeales, Matoniales and
    Dicksoniales. The material occurs in form of rhizomes, petioles, roots,
    sporangia and spores. In the present paper however, anatomy of only
    vegetative parts is described.

    BackgroundFerns, originated about 360 million years ago, are the sister
    group of seed plants. Despite the remarkable progress in our understanding
    of fern phylogeny, with conflicting molecular evidence and different
    morphological interpretations, relationships among major fern lineages
    remain controversial.ResultsWith the aim to obtain a robust fern phylogeny,
    we carried out a large-scale phylogenomic analysis using high-quality
    transcriptome sequencing data, which covered 69 fern species from 38
    families and 11 orders. Both coalescent-based and concatenation-based
    methods were applied to both nucleotide and amino acid sequences in species
    tree estimation. The resulting topologies are largely congruent with each
    other, except for the placement of Angiopteris fokiensis, Cheiropleuria
    bicuspis, Diplaziopsis brunoniana, Matteuccia struthiopteris, Elaphoglossum
    mcclurei, and Tectaria subpedata.ConclusionsOur result confirmed that
    Equisetales is sister to the rest of ferns, and Dennstaedtiaceae is sister
    to eupolypods. Moreover, our result strongly supported some relationships
    different from the current view of fern phylogeny, including that
    Marattiaceae may be sister to the monophyletic clade of Psilotaceae and
    Ophioglossaceae; that Gleicheniaceae and Hymenophyllaceae form a
    monophyletic clade sister to Dipteridaceae; and that Aspleniaceae is sister
    to the rest of the groups in eupolypods II. These results were interpreted
    with morphological traits, especially sporangia characters, and a new
    evolutionary route of sporangial annulus in ferns was suggested. This
    backbone phylogeny in ferns sets a foundation for further studies in biology
    and evolution in ferns, and therefore in plants.

    genera. Filicopsida, the largest group of the flora, is composed of 29
    species including 9 families, which amount to 36.7% of the flora.
    Dicksoniaceae of 8 species is the most dominant family. Among all members of
    Filicopsida, Acanthopteris gothani Sze is the most abundant species. The
    paper also s! udies the sporangia and spores in situ of 11 species including
    the new species.

    The Blechnaceae is one of the most speciose fern families in New Zealand,
    with two genera represented: Blechnum and Doodia. We sequenced the
    chloroplast trnL-trnF locus for all of the Blechnaceae species indigenous to
    New Zealand, plus several non-indigenous species. Although deeper
    relationships were not well resolved by phylogenetic analyses of these DNA
    sequences, several groupings of species were consistently recovered. Some of
    these relationships have been previously suspected on the basis of
    morphological similarity and/or hybridisation (e.g., the B. procerum group),
    and are consistent with variation in base chromosome numbers, but others
    were unexpected (e.g., the relationship of B. fluviatile and B. vulcanicum).
    The species of Doodia sampled here were found to be monophyletic, and were
    nested within a paraphyletic Blechnum. Infraspecific variation in the
    trnL-trnF locus was detected within six New Zealand species, and may prove
    useful for future phylogeographic and taxonomic studies.

    Recent generalisations about polyploidy in plants have been largely based on
    studies of angiosperms. A compelling group to compare with angiosperms is
    ferns, because of their high polyploidy. The bi-parental inheritance of
    nuclear DNA sequence markers makes them advantageous for investigating
    polyploid complexes, but few such markers have been available for ferns. We
    have used DNA sequences from the low-copy nuclear LFY locus to study an
    Asplenium polyploid complex. The New Zealand species of this Austral group
    comprise seven tetraploids and eight octoploids. LFY sequences indicate that
    allopolyploidy is much more predominant than previously thought, being
    implicated in the origins of seven of the octoploids. One of the tetraploids
    has had a central role, being a progenitor for five of the octoploids. All
    of the octoploids appear to have relatively recent origins, with the dynamic
    environmental conditions of the Pleistocene possibly playing a role in their
    formation and/or establishment.

    molecular data for 14 species from the chloroplast DNA intergenic spacer
    region trnL-Findicates that species of the genus Anemia fall into two
    well-supported subgenera,Anemiorrhizaand Anemia. In addition, one species of
    the genus Mohria appears to belong within Anemia. Although further study is
    required, these data support the relationships suggested by a previous study
    of fossil and extant representativesof the genus.

  abstract: >-
    New Zealand is home to 16 endemic species of Lepidium (Brassicaceae),
    including two species considered to have become extinct since European
    colonisation and an additional species shared with Australia. Previous
    meiotic chromosome counts suggest at least some are high polyploids. A
    hybrid origin has been proposed for several of them, with African and
    American species implicated as parents. We generated amplicon sequence data
    for 15 genes derived from targeted enrichment data from a selection of
    species endemic to New Zealand, and of African, American, and Australian
    origin naturalised in New Zealand. These were analysed, along with publicly
    available genomic data from other Lepidium species. Our results are
    consistent with earlier work in supporting two main groups of endemic New
    Zealand Lepidium, corresponding to different dominant nrDNA sequences. Our
    data suggest that these two groups differ in ploidy (one octoploid, the
    ploidy of the other uncertain). The octoploid species combine four
    distinguishable subgenomes and the other species may be the products of
    allopolyploidisation between octoploid species and a diploid species closely
    related to, if not, L. africanum. Previously proposed links to American
    Lepidium are also supported, with at least two Australasian Lepidium
    subgenomes related to subgenomes present in American polyploid species. The
    affinities of two further subgenomes present in Australasian Lepidium remain
    to be determined, but they may also be of American origin. One New Zealand
    endemic species, L. naufragorum, displays sequences broadly consistent with
    it being the octodecaploid product of hybridisation between octoploid and
    decaploid New Zealand groups.

    chromatographic study of reticulate evolution in the Appalachian Asplenium
    complex. Amer. Jour. Bot. 50(9): 952-\l58. Illus. 1963.-The reticulate
    relationships of the members of the Appalachian Asplenium complex were
    studied by means of paper chromatography. Substances could be observed with
    ultraviolet light in the presence of ammonia vapor in all tbe taxa of the
    complex. The diploid species (A. montanum, A. platyneuron and A.
    rliizoplutlluni) had characteristic biochemical substances. Interspecific
    hybrids and/or their allotetraploid derivatives showed a complete
    complementation of all the substances of their known or presumed diploid
    ancestors. A combination of all the substances of the 3 diploids was found
    in the hybrids A. X kcniuckiensc and A. X gravesii. The results agree in all
    respects with the concept of reticulate evolution in the group which was
    advanced by Wagner on the basis of comparative morphology, hybridization and
    karyology.

  abstract: >-
    The percentage of pantropical and amphioceanic genera of ferns far exceeds
    similar percentages for angiosperms. Conversely, the number of "endemic"
    fern genera is much lower than the comparable figure for flowering plants.
    Comparison of the two groups of plants on islands points out even more
    strikingly the lower percentages of generic and specific endemism of ferns.
    These distributional differences cannot be accounted for by the longer
    geologic history of ferns, but can be attributed to their greater
    dispersibility. The wider distribution of ferns, together with the absence
    of many of the speciation barriers operative in angiosperms, has contributed
    to a relatively slower rate of speciation in the ferns, and probably also to
    a lower extinction rate. Delimitation of generic and suprageneric taxa is
    therefore more difficult in many cases.

    Basemd ainly on collections made in the last few years, we document 145
    species and one additional variety of pteridophytes for the first time in
    Bolivia. Full specimen citations, previously known distributions,and, where
    appropriate,taxonomic notes are given for all taxa. The remarkableBolivian
    pteridophyteflorapreviously has been amongthe most poorly known in the
    world, and it has been thought to be less diverse than the floras of other
    Andean countries. Recent collections, of both described and undescribed
    species, suggest that Bolivia rivals other Andean florasin richness and
    permitmore accuratetaxonomic and phytogeographiccomparisons with fern
    florasfrom adjacentareas.

    We describe and illustrate Metaxya lanosa, the second known species in the
    genus and the fern family Metaxyaceae (Pteridophyta). It is currently known
    from four different watersheds in Amazonian Peru and Venezuela. It can be
    distinguished readily from M. rostrata by the noticeably woolly-hairy stipes
    and rachises (hairs red-brown or orange-brown and easily abraded), broader,
    more elliptic pinnae, cartilaginous and whitish pinna margins, more distinct
    veins abaxially, and longer pinna stalks, especially on the distal pinnae.
    rbcL data from a very limited sampling are ambiguous but do not reject
    support for the recognition of at least two species within Metaxya.

  abstract: >-
    We describe the neotropical fern genus Serpocaulon (Polypodiaceae),
    segregated from Polypodium, and make new combinations for the forty known
    species. Serpocaulon has been recognized previously as a putatively natural
    group by several authors, based on morphological evidence, but never
    accorded generic rank. The monophyly of Serpocaulon is strongly supported in
    chloroplast DNA-based phylogenetic analyses, using the genes rbcL, rps4,
    rps4-trnS intergenic spacer, and trnL-F intergenic spacer on 29 samples from
    22 species. Serpocaulon is readily separated from other subclades within
    Polypodiaceae, and especially from Polypodium, which is less closely related
    to Serpocaulon than are several other genera. Serpocaulon differs from other
    New World polypods in the combination of usually long-creeping, sparingly
    branched rhizomes with clathrate (sometimes strongly so), usually peltately
    attached scales; regularly anastomosing (goniophlebioid) veins with
    individual areoles chevron-shaped and each with a single, free, included
    excurrent veinlet; and non-paraphysate sori in one to 10 rows between costae
    and pinna margins. In Polypodium, the rhizome scales are not clathrate, ±
    concolorous, and invaginated at the base, with somewhat overlapping basal
    lobes, and rhizomes are generally shorter-creeping and more frequently
    branched, the veins are free or forming a single row of areoles, and the
    sori uniseriate on each side of the costae. Most species of true Polypodium
    are north-temperate, Mexican, or Mesoamerican in distribution, while
    Serpocaulon is entirely neotropical or subtropical, with the greatest number
    of species in South America. There appears to be no convenient infrageneric
    division of the species within Serpocaulon, although the most widespread
    species, S. triseriale, is somewhat isolated at the base of the clade.
    Species with the thinnest rhizomes also have the fewest scales, and
    generally grow at high elevations. Species having the scaliest rhizomes,
    with scales spreading and strongly overlapping, form a weakly supported
    subclade, as do species with multiseriate rows of areoles between costae and
    pinna margins.

    Relationships among the major subclades in the fern family Pteridaceae have
    proven difﬁcult to resolve. Here, we examine the backbone of this large and
    heterogeneous lineage using both phylotranscriptomic methods and a more
    focused, curated approach. We ﬁnd that Pteridoideae and Parkerioideae are
    together sister to the rest of Pteridaceae and that Cryptogrammoideae is
    sister to Vittarioideae plus Cheilanthoideae. We ﬁnd independent support
    from our phylotranscriptomic analyses, published cytological data, and
    genomic distributions of substitutions per site for several whole-genome
    duplication (WGD) events within Pteridaceae, mainly in Vittarioideae and
    Cheilanthoideae. However, the various inference methods gave differing
    approximations for the placement of WGD events within each clade. This study
    demonstrates that phylotranscriptomic analyses, which employ large datasets
    at the cost of requiring simpler models and potentially a greater risk of
    systematic error, can be used in concert with more curated approaches to
    resolve deep phylogenetic relationships. It also provides an example of the
    difﬁculty of conﬁdently inferring ancient WGD event placement, even when
    using multiple methods.

    Azolla is a genus of freshwater ferns that is economically important as a
    nitrogen-fixing biofertilizer, biofuel, bioremediator, and for potential
    carbon sequestration, but also contains weedy invasive species. In
    California, only 2 species are currently recognized but the actual diversity
    may include up to 6 species, with the discrepancy being due to the
    difficulty in identifying taxa, hybridization, and the introduction of
    non-native species. Here, we report a new haplotype-resolved,
    chromosome-level assembly and annotation of Azolla caroliniana as part of
    the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP), using a combination of
    PacBio HiFi and Omni-C sequencing technologies. The assembly is 521 Mb in
    length, with a contig N50 of 1.6 Mb, and is scaffolded into 22
    pseudochromosomes. A total of 21,848 protein-coding genes was predicted with
    a Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) completeness score of
    89.88%. In combination with the previously published Azola filiculoides
    genome, this A. caroliniana genome will be a powerful tool for understanding
    the population genetics and taxonomy of one of the most cryptic,
    economically important, and poorly circumscribed fern taxa, and for
    facilitating land plant genomics more broadly.

    Azolla Lam. (Salviniaceae) was collected and sequenced across California as
    a part of the California Conservation Genomics Project. We identify three
    major populations of Azolla in the state. Out of these groups, we can
    conﬁdently identify one as Azolla ﬁliculoides. The other two taxa are
    seemingly newly reported to California and are not the same as the taxa
    currently treated by the Jepson Manual; speciﬁcally, they are not members of
    the A. microphylla/mexicana clade. We infer patterns of Azolla genetic
    diversity across the state and the demographic histories of these
    populations. We ﬁnd evidence that both isolation by distance and isolation
    by environment contribute to spatial genetic variation. Both of the two
    newly reported populations have demographic histories consistent with recent
    invasions of the state. However, we also discuss alternative possibilities
    and propose a roadmap for resolving the taxonomy of California Azolla.

    Methods: We sequenced 112 Azolla specimens collected across the state of
    California and characterized their metagenomes to identify the common
    bacterial endosymbionts and assess their patterns of interaction.

    Results: Four genera were found across all samples, establishing that
    multiple Azolla endosymbionts were consistently present. We found varying
    degrees of cophylogenetic signal across these taxa as well as varying
    degrees of isolation by distance and of pseudogenation, which demonstrates
    that multiple processes underlie how this endosymbiotic community is
    constituted. We also characterized the entire Azolla leaf pocket microbiome.

    Conclusions: These results show that the Azolla symbiotic community is
    complex and features members at potentially diﬀerent stages of symbiosis
    evolution, further supporting the utility of the Azolla microcosm as a
    system for studying the evolution of symbioses.

  abstract: >-
    Aquatic macrophytes play an important role in the structural and functional
    aspects of aquatic ecosystems by altering water movement regimes, providing
    shelter to ﬁsh and aquatic invertebrates, serving as a food source, and
    altering water quality by regulating oxygen balance, nutrient cycles, and
    accumulating heavy metals. The ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals makes
    them interesting research candidates, especially for the treatment of
    industrial efﬂuents and sewage waste water. The use of aquatic macrophytes,
    such as Azolla with hyper accumulating ability is known to be an
    environmentally friendly option to restore polluted aquatic resources. The
    present review highlights the phytoaccumulation potential of macrophytes
    with emphasis on utilization of Azolla as a promising candidate for
    phytoremediation. The impact of uptake of heavy metals on morphology and
    metabolic processes of Azolla has also been discussed for a better
    understanding and utilization of this symbiotic association in the ﬁeld of
    phytoremediation.

  abstract: >-
    Twenty six species, one additional subspecies and one additional cultivar of
    the genus Pteris occurring in South India are treated, of which 4 taxa are
    cultivated or locally adventive exotics. Their descriptions, a key to the
    species, their reported chromosome numbers, taxonomic comments and colour
    photographs are provided. Of these, P. reptans T.G.Walker had not been
    recorded before in India until the report by Sreenivas (2011 ined.) and P.
    arisanensis Tagawa and P. perrottetii Hieron. had not previously been
    reported from Kerala state. Comments are made concerning some of the
    taxonomically confused species and the conservation status of the species is
    listed.

  abstract: >-
    Polyploidy and hybridization are important processes in seed-free plant
    evolution. However, a major gap lies in our understanding of how these
    processes affect the evolutionary history of high-ploidy systems. The
    heterosporous lycophyte genus Isoe¨tes is a lineage with many putative
    hybrids and high-level polyploid taxa (ranging from tetraploid to
    dodecaploid). Here, we use a complex of western North American Isoe¨tes, to
    understand the role of hybridization and high-level polyploidy in generating
    and maintaining novel diversity. To uncover these processes, we use
    restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), multiple alleles of a
    single low-copy nuclear marker, whole plastomes, cytology (genome size
    estimates and chromosome counts), and reproductive status (fertile or
    sterile). With this dataset, we show that hybridization occurs easily
    between species in this complex and is bidirectional between identical, but
    not different, cytotypes. Furthermore, we show that fertile allopolyploids
    appear to have formed repeatedly from sterile homoploid and interploid
    hybrids. We propose that low prezygotic reproductive barriers and a high
    frequency of whole-genome duplication allow for high-level polyploid systems
    to generate novel lineages, and that these mechanisms may be important in
    shaping extant Isoe¨tes diversity.

  abstract: >-
    A contemporary interpretation of Dollo’s Law states that the evolution of a
    specialized structure is irreversible. Among land plants, reproductive
    specialization shows a trend toward increasing complexity without reversion,
    raising questions about evolutionary steps and the irreversibility of
    reproductive complexity. Ferns exhibit varied reproductive strategies; some
    are dimorphic (producing separate leaves for photosynthesis and
    reproduction), while others are monomorphic (where one leaf is used for both
    photosynthesis and spore dispersal). This diversity provides an opportunity
    to examine the applicability of Dollo’s Law in the evolution of reproductive
    leaf specialization. We analyzed 118 species in Blechnaceae and Onocleaceae,
    applying quantitative morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods to
    test the pillars of a modernized interpretation of Dollo’s Law. The
    evolution of dimorphism in Blechnaceae is neither stepwise nor irreversible,
    with direct transitions from monomorphism to dimorphism, including several
    reversions. In contrast, Onocleaceae exhibits an irreversibility to
    monomorphism only upon further specialization of fertile leaves for
    humidity-driven spore dispersal; this suggests that additional
    specialization, not dimorphism alone, may facilitate irreversibility. These
    results provide insight into the canalization of fertile-sterile leaf
    dimorphism in seed plants, where the addition of traits like heterospory and
    integuments lead to further specialization and potential irreversibility.
    These findings suggest that as new specialized traits evolve alongside
    preexisting ones, reversion may become increasingly unlikely.

    Background and AimsPatterns of morphological evolution at levels above
    family rank remain underexplored in the ferns. The present study seeks to
    address this gap through analysis of 79 morphological characters for 81
    taxa, including representatives of all ten families of eupolypod II ferns.
    Recent molecular phylogenetic studies demonstrate that the evolution of the
    large eupolypod II clade (which includes nearly one-third of extant fern
    species) features unexpected patterns. The traditional 'athyrioid' ferns are
    scattered across the phylogeny despite their apparent morphological
    cohesiveness, and mixed among these seemingly conservative taxa are
    morphologically dissimilar groups that lack any obvious features uniting
    them with their relatives. Maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony
    character optimizations are used to determine characters that unite the
    seemingly disparate groups, and to test whether the polyphyly of the
    traditional athyrioid ferns is due to evolutionary stasis (symplesiomorphy)
    or convergent evolution. The major events in eupolypod II character
    evolution are reviewed, and character and character state concepts are
    reappraised, as a basis for further inquiries into fern morphology.
    MethodsCharacters were scored from the literature, live plants and herbarium
    specimens, and optimized using maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood,
    onto a highly supported topology derived from maximum-likelihood and
    Bayesian analysis of molecular data. Phylogenetic signal of characters were
    tested for using randomization methods and fitdiscrete.Key ResultsThe
    majority of character state changes within the eupolypod II phylogeny occur
    at the family level or above. Relative branch lengths for the morphological
    data resemble those from molecular data and fit an ancient rapid radiation
    model (long branches subtended by very short backbone internodes), with few
    characters uniting the morphologically disparate clades. The traditional
    athyrioid ferns were circumscribed based upon a combination of
    symplesiomorphic and homoplastic characters. Petiole vasculature consisting
    of two bundles is ancestral for eupolypods II and a synapomorphy for
    eupolypods II under deltran optimization. Sori restricted to one side of the
    vein defines the recently recognized clade comprising Rhachidosoraceae
    through Aspleniaceae, and sori present on both sides of the vein is a
    synapomorphy for the Athyriaceae sensu stricto. The results indicate that a
    chromosome base number of x =41 is synapomorphic for all eupolypods, a clade
    that includes over two-thirds of extant fern species.ConclusionsThe
    integrated approach synthesizes morphological studies with current
    phylogenetic hypotheses and provides explicit statements of character
    evolution in the eupolypod II fern families. Strong character support is
    found for previously recognized clades, whereas few characters support
    previously unrecognized clades. Sorus position appears to be less
    complicated than previously hypothesized, and linear sori restricted to one
    side of the vein support the clade comprising Aspleniaceae,
    Diplaziopsidaceae, Hemidictyaceae and Rachidosoraceae - a lineage only
    recently identified. Despite x =41 being a frequent number among extant
    species, to our knowledge it has not previously been demonstrated as the
    ancestral state. This is the first synapomorphy proposed for the eupolypod
    clade, a lineage comprising 67 % of extant fern species. This study provides
    some of the first hypotheses of character evolution at the family level and
    above in light of recent phylogenetic results, and promotes further study in
    an area that remains open for original observation. © The Author 2013.

    Mitotic and meiotic chromosomes were examined in a total of 162 plants
    representing 16 taxa in the Japanese Diplazium, including polymorphic
    terrestrial species with evergreen bi- to tripinnate leaves. Diplazium
    hachijoense, D. virescens var. virescens, var. conterminum, var. okina
    waense, and two other unnamed varieties, D, kawakamii var, kawakamii, D,
    dilatatum var. heterolepia, D. taiwanense, D. x kawabatae (=D. dilatatum X
    taiwanense), D,X takii (=D, hachijoense x virescens var. virescens), and D.
    x nakamurae (=D, hachijoense X virescens var. conterminum) are apomictic
    triploids (2n=n=123), Diplazium amamianum and D. esculentum are sexual
    diploids (2n= 82, n=41) and D, subtripinnatum is a sexual tetraploid
    (2n=164,n=82), Diplazium dilatatum var. dilatatum includes both sexual
    diploid and apomictic triploid populations. Cultivated gametophytes of six
    triploid taxa produced sporophytes apogamously, confirming their apomictic
    reproduction. All three putative hybrids, D.Xkawabatae, D.xtakii, and
    D.Xnakamurae, are triploid, apomictic, and fertile taxa, therefore they are
    not the result of hybridization between known pairs of Japanese Diplazium
    plants.

    Two cytotypes, an apomictic triploid (2np123) and an apomictic tetraploid
    (2np164), were found in  Japanese Diplazium doederleinii. The cytotypes are
    clearly distinguishable from each other in phytogeograph-  ical, ecological,
    and morphological characteristics. The tetraploid is smaller in relation to
    several morphological  characteristics and occurs in more northerly regions
    than the triploid. The distributions of the two cytotypes  do not overlap.
    The leaves of the triploids are evergreen, while those of the tetraploids
    are summer-green.  Allozyme analysis indicated that one and four multilocus
    genotypes are contained in the tetraploid and triploid,  respectively. The
    nucleotide sequence of the rbcL gene did not vary within the same cytotype,
    except for a  single triploid with the same rbcL sequence as the tetraploid.
    There are only two nucleotide differences between  the triploid and
    tetraploid races. These results indicate that the apomictic triploids are of
    recurrent origin from  an undiscovered or extinct ancestral diploid and that
    the apomictic tetraploid originated through autopoly-  ploidy from the
    ancestral diploid or from hybridization between the triploid and the
    ancestral diploid.

    Christensenia (Marattiaceae) is recorded for the island of New Guinea,
    removing a puzzling disjunction in its documented distribution. The rarely
    seen Rheopteris cheesmaniae (Pteridaceae), previously represented by three
    specimens, is rediscovered in Sepik habitats far inland from the historical
    north-coastal localities. Population updates are also provided for Dipteris
    lobbiana (Dipteridaceae), a species found throughout Malesia but otherwise
    known in New Guinea only from the upper Sepik. All three ferns are
    surprisingly common at their new sites of occurrence.

    … Pivotal results. Here we provide the first examination of gametophyte
    morphology and sporophyte growthhabit in this species as well as the first
    conclusive documentation of primary hemiepiphytism in the Polypodiaceae.
    Phylogenetic analyses place C. ampla in a small clade of probable
    hemiepiphytes closely allied to theOld World ant-fern genus Lecanopteris. We
    infer a transition from epiphytism to hemiepiphytism in the cladeconsisting
    of C. ampla and closely related species, the first such transitional series
    reported for the polypodferns. A hemiepiphyte syndrome consisting of
    gametophyte, rhizome, root, and leaf characteristics is presentedto guide
    future investigation of this growth habit.  Conclusions. Hemiepiphytes are
    likely underreported among climber- and epiphyte-rich groups of
    ferns.Primary hemiepiphytes may be more frequently derived from
    holoepiphytic ancestors because epiphytic gametophytesand sporophytes are
    preadapted to hemiepiphytic growth. We propose that hemiepiphytism providesa
    mechanism for acquisition of stable nutrient and water supplies by
    tree-dwelling plants.

  abstract: >-
    Ferns are the second-most diverse lineage of vascular plants on Earth, yet
    the best-sampled timecalibrated phylogeny of the group to date includes
    fewer than 5% of global diversity and was published seven years ago. We
    present a time-calibrated phylogeny that includes nearly half of extant fern
    diversity. Our results are evaluated in the context of previous studies and
    the fossil record, and we develop new hypotheses about the radiation of
    leptosporangiate ferns. We used sequence data from six chloroplast regions
    for nearly 4000 species of ferns to generate the most comprehensive
    phylogeny of the group ever published. We calibrate the phylogeny with
    twenty-six fossils and use an array of phylogenetic methods to resolve
    phylogenetic relationships, estimate divergence times, and infer speciation,
    extinction, and net diversiﬁcation rates. We infer a mid-late Silurian
    origin for ferns (including horsetails) and an early Carboniferous origin
    for leptosporangiate ferns. Most derived fern families appeared in the
    Cretaceous and persisted for millions of years before rapidly diversifying
    in the Cenozoic. We ﬁnd no evidence of differential rates of diversiﬁcation
    among terrestrial and epiphytic species. Our ﬁndings challenge previous
    hypotheses on the evolutionary history of ferns and present a new paradigm
    for their Cenozoic radiation. We estimate earlier divergences for most fern
    lineages than were reported in previous studies and provide evidence of
    extended persistence of major fern lineages prior to rapid diversiﬁcation in
    the last ﬁfty million years.

    Abstract
                
                  Island systems provide important contexts for studying processes underlying lineage migration, species diversification, and organismal extinction. The Hawaiian endemic mints (Lamiaceae family) are the second largest plant radiation on the isolated Hawaiian Islands. We generated a chromosome-scale reference genome for one Hawaiian species,
                  Stenogyne calaminthoides
                  , and resequenced 45 relatives, representing 34 species, to uncover the continental origins of this group and their subsequent diversification. We further resequenced 109 individuals of two
                  Stenogyne
                  species, and their purported hybrids, found high on the Mauna Kea volcano on the island of Hawai’i. The three distinct Hawaiian genera,
                  Haplostachys
                  ,
                  Phyllostegia
                  , and
                  Stenogyne
                  , are nested inside a fourth genus,
                  Stachys
                  . We uncovered four independent polyploidy events within
                  Stachys
                  , including one allopolyploidy event underlying the Hawaiian mints and their direct western North American ancestors. While the Hawaiian taxa may have principally diversified by parapatry and drift in small and fragmented populations, localized admixture may have played an important role early in lineage diversification. Our genomic analyses provide a view into how organisms may have radiated on isolated island chains, settings that provided one of the principal natural laboratories for Darwin’s thinking about the evolutionary process.

    Many species of seedless vascular plants-ferns and lycopods-have been used
    as food and folk medicine since ancient times. Some of them have become the
    focus of intensive research concerning their anticancer properties. Studies
    on the anticancer effect of crude extracts are being increasingly replaced
    by bioactivity-guided fractionation, as well as detailed assessment of the
    mechanism of action. Numerous compounds-especially flavonoids such as
    amentoflavone and protoapigenone, and also simpler phenolic compounds,
    steroids, alkaloids and terpenoids-were isolated and found to be cytotoxic,
    particularly pro-apoptotic, or to induce cell cycle arrest in cancer cell
    lines in vitro. In in vivo experiments, some fern-derived compounds
    inhibited tumour growth with little toxicity. On the other hand, many
    ferns-not only the well-known Bracken (Pteridium)-may pose a significant
    hazard to human health due to the fact that they contain carcinogenic
    sesquiterpenoids and their analogues. The objective of this review is to
    summarise the recent state of research on the anticancer properties of ferns
    and lycopods, with a focus on their characteristic bioactive constituents.
    The carcinogenic hazard posed by ferns is also mentioned. Copyright © 2013

    Abstract Chloroplast DNA sequences were obtained from 331 Asplenium ceterach
    plants representing 143 populations from throughout the range of the complex
    in Europe, plus outlying sites in North Africa and the near East. We
    identified nine distinct haplotypes from a 900 bp fragment of trnL-trnF
    gene. Tetraploid populations were encountered throughout Europe and further
    afield, whereas diploid populations were scarcer and predominated in the
    Pannonian-Balkan region. Hexaploids were encountered only in southern
    Mediterranean populations. Four haplotypes were found among diploid
    populations of the Pannonian-Balkans indicating that this region formed a
    northern Pleistocene refugium. A separate polyploid complex centred on
    Greece, comprises diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid populations with two
    endemic haplotypes and suggests long-term persistence of populations in the
    southern Mediterranean. Three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) haplotypes were common
    among tetraploids in Spain and Italy, with diversity reducing northwards
    suggesting expansion from the south after the Pleistocene. Our cpDNA and
    ploidy data indicate at least six independent origins of polyploids.

    During the performance of a preliminary phyogenetic study of Pecluma M.G.
    Price (Polypodiaceae), eight genera of the family were studied, as well as
    Oleandra Cav. (Oleandraceae), which was an element of the outgroup. The
    morphology of the spores was studied, because it is a phylogeneticaly
    unexplored information source. It was observed using high vacuum scanning
    electron microscopy. Three spore characters were studied: “chlorophyllous
    spores”, “shape” and “ornamentation”. The distribution of the spore
    characters on the strict consensus cladogram shows that ornamentation tends
    to be constant within genera, and it allows the recognition of intergeneric
    differences. Thus, the studied characters could be a useful source to
    precise the genera or species complexes that present a conflictive taxonomic
    situation within the family (v.g. Polypodium dulce group).

    (2892) Proposal to conserve the name *Dennstaedtia* (Dennstaedtiaceae) with
    a conserved type
  type: article-journal
  volume: '71'

- id: triana-moreno2022phylogenetic
  abstract: >-
    We undertook a molecular phylogenetic revision of hayscented ferns
    (Dennstaedtiaceae: Dennstaedtioideae) using four plastid markers. Our
    sampling represents ca. 40% of the extant diversity and includes the type
    species for each of the relevant segregate genera. We coded 18 discrete
    morphological characters which we used to find diagnosable clades. We show
    that Dennstaedtia is polyphyletic, with the majority of species forming
    three morphologically distinct clades, but its type (D. flaccida) is nested
    within Microlepia. As such, we support the conservation of Dennstaedtia with
    a new type, D. dissecta. Following our results, we develop a classification
    of four genera: Dennstaedtia, Microlepia, Mucura (gen. nov.) and Sitobolium.
    Beyond the inclusion of D. flaccida, we propose to maintain Microlepia with
    its current circumscription. Except for a single adventive species in the
    Neotropics, Microlepia is a Paleotropical genus of about 60 species
    diagnosed by their distinctive perispore ornamentation of rodlets, and by
    petioles that lack epipetiolar buds. Mucura is a Neotropical genus of two
    species that differ from all other Dennstaedtiaceae by the combination of
    dichotomously branching rhizomes, petioles that lack epipetiolar buds,
    marginal sori with both abaxial and adaxial indusia, and trilete spores with
    a unique perispore ornamentation. As defined here, Dennstaedtia is a
    pantropical genus of about 55 species recognized by having unbranched
    rhizomes, petioles bearing epipetiolar buds, and by often bearing
    proliferous buds upon the leaves. Sitobolium is a small clade of ca. five
    species distinguished by their relatively small leaves that have elongate
    catenate hairs. These hairs often bear a capitate non-glandular terminal
    cell. In support of our classification, we provide a key to the eleven
    genera of Dennstaedtiaceae, and for the four genera of Dennstaedtioideae we
    provide morphological and geographic synopses, a list of constituent
    species, and necessary new combinations.

    The effects of single chromosome number change—dysploidy – mediating
    diversiﬁcation remain poorly understood. Dysploidy modiﬁes recombination
    rates, linkage, or reproductive isolation, especially for one-ﬁfth of all
    eukaryote lineages with holocentric chromosomes. Dysploidy effects on
    diversiﬁcation have not been estimated because modeling chromosome numbers
    linked to diversiﬁcation with heterogeneity along phylogenies is
    quantitatively challenging.

    Methods: By phasing captured reads within a phylogenomic data set of GoFlag
    408 nuclear loci using HybPhaser, we investigated candidate hybrids to
    identify parental lineages. We estimated divergence ages by inferring a
    dated phylogeny using fossil calibrations with treePL. We investigated
    ecological niche conservatism between one conﬁrmed intergeneric
    allotetraploid and its diploid progenitors using the centroid, overlap,
    unﬁlling, and expansion (COUE) framework.

    Results: We provide evidence for at least six instances of intergeneric
    hybrid speciation within the christelloid clade and estimate up to 45
    million years of divergence between progenitors. The niche quantiﬁcation
    analysis showed moderate niche overlap between an allopolyploid species and
    its progenitors, with signiﬁcant divergence from the niche of one progenitor
    and conservatism to the other.

    Conclusions: The examples provided here highlight the overlooked role that
    allopolyploidization following intergeneric hybridization may play in fern
    diversiﬁcation and range and niche expansions. Applying this approach to
    other fern taxa may reveal a similar pattern of deep hybridization resulting
    in highly successful novel lineages.

  abstract: >-
    A molecular phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of atpB, rbcL, accD,
    atpB-rbcL spacer, and rbcL-accD spacer was made for Davalliaceae with a
    focus on four systematically uncertain and nomenclaturally influential
    species. The result shows that Davalliaceae comprises six clades. Davallia
    plumosa is sister to Scyphularia pentaphylla and S. pycnocarpa. Scyphularia
    triphylla is sister to a clade comprising other Scyphularia, Davallia
    plumosa, D. solida, and related species, indicating that imparipinnate
    leaves are derived twice within the clade. Humata heterophylla is sister to
    the H. polypodioides group, one of two groups of Humata, in which Davallia
    corniculata is nested. Paradavallodes multidentatum is nested in Araiostegia
    + Davallodes, which is a polymorphic basal clade. African Davallia
    chaerophylloides is allied to an Asian and Pacific group comprising D.
    denticulata and related species.

    Abstract
                
                  Although hybridization between non-sibling species rarely results in viable or fertile offspring, it occasionally produces self-perpetuating or sexually-parasitic lineages in which ancestral genomes are inherited clonally and thus may persist as ‘ghost species’ after ancestor extinction. Ghost species have been detected in animals and plants, for polyploid and diploid organisms, and across clonal, semi-clonal, and even sexual reproductive modes. Here we use a detailed investigation of the evolutionary and taxonomic status of a newly-discovered, putative ghost lineage (HX) in the fish genus
                  Hypseleotris
                  to provide perspectives on several important issues not previously explored by other studies on ghost species, but relevant to ongoing discussions about their detection, conservation, and artificial re-creation. Our comprehensive genetic (allozymes, mtDNA) and genomic (SNPs) datasets successfully identified a threatened sexual population of HX in one tiny portion of the extensive distribution displayed by two hemi-clonal HX-containing lineages. We also discuss what confidence should be placed on any assertion that an ancestral species is actually extinct, and how to assess whether any putative sexual ancestor represents a pure remnant, as shown here, or a naturally-occurring resurrection via the crossing of compatible clones or hemi-clones.

    A study of spores of the single species of the genus Parahemionitis
    Panigrahi was performed using the method of scanning electronic microscopy
    (SEM). Spores of Parahemionitis arifolia (Burm. f.) Panigrahi are
    tetrahedral trilete, roundish-triangular in polar position, with
    micro-wrinkled exospore and sculptured perispore. Sculpture of perispore is
    cristate-reticulate, cristae are quite regularly distributed and form
    reticulum with small mostly closed polygonal luminae of different shape.
    Laesura arms are often obscured by numerous cristae. Size of spores is 53–63
    × 40–42 μm. Spores of P. arifolia are similar in perispore sculpture with
    those of species of some cheilanthoid ferns.

    Three new Selaginella species from Cuba, S. myriostachya, S. nanophylla and
    S. phiara, are described, illustrated with Scanning Electron Micrographs,
    and compared to similar species. Selaginella myriostachya and S. phiara are
    from Pinar del Río province, the latter one is also found in Isla de la
    Juventud special municipality, both in the western part of Cuba. In
    contrast, S. nanophylla is from Guantánamo, Holguín, and Santiago de Cuba
    provinces in the eastern part of the island. Information about their
    habitat, distribution, and conservation status is provided. Selaginella
    myriostachya lives in cave openings on limestone rocks in Mogotes
    formations; S. nanophylla is one of the smallest plants reported for the
    genus and seems adapted to serpentine soils. Selaginella phiara has
    idioblasts with several bright, papillae on the upper surface of median
    leaves and lower surface of lateral leaves, and short hairs on the upper
    surface of the apices of median leaves.

    Two new species of Selaginella P. Beauv., S. angustifolia Valdespino and S.
    solomonii Valdespino, from the department of La Paz in Bolivia are
    described, and S. minima Spring is reported as new to the country.
    Selaginella angustifolia may be confused with S. chionoloma Alston ex Crabbe
    & Jermy from which it differs by the lamina shape and apex type of the
    median leaves. Selaginella solomonii differs from S. cavifolia A. Braun, a
    species with similar median leaves, by its habit, rhizophore distribution on
    stem, lateral leaf marginal projections, and lack of a laminal flap on
    sporophylls. This account brings the known number of Selaginella species
    recorded for Bolivia to 37.

  abstract: >-
    The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify random sequences of DNA
    from 25 accessions of Azolla to evaluate the usefulness of this technique
    for identification and phylogenetic analysis of this aquatic fern.
    Accessions were selected to represent all known species within the genus
    Azolla and to encompass the world-wide distribution of the fern. Primers of
    10 nucleotides with 70% G + C content were used to generate randomly
    amplified polymorphic DNA from the symbiotic Azolla-Anabaena complex.
    Twenty-two primers were used and each primer gave 4-10 bands of different
    molecular weights for each accession. Bands were scored as present or absent
    for each accession and variation among accessions was quantified using
    Nei&apos;s genetic distances. A dendrogram summarizing phenetic
    relationships among the 25 accessions was generated using the unweighted
    pair-group method with arithmetic mean. Principal component analysis was
    also used to evaluate genetic similarities. Three distinct groups were
    identified: group 1 contains five species, group 2 contains the pinnata
    species, and group 3 contains the nilotica species. The analysis
    demonstrates that the major groups of Azolla species can be easily
    distinguished from one an other and, in addition, that closely related
    accessions within species can be identified. We further found that using 10
    primers, a phylogeny that is essentially the same as that derived from 22
    primers can be constructed. Our results suggest that total DNA extracted
    from the Azolla-Anabaena symbionts is useful for classification and
    phylogenetic studies of Azolla.

  abstract: >-
    The cyanobacterium Anabaena has both symbiotic and free-living forms. The
    genetic diversity of Anabaena strains symbiotically associated with the
    aquatic fern Azolla and the evolutionary relationships among these symbionts
    were evaluated by means of RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism)
    experiments. Three DNA fragments corresponding to nif genes were cloned from
    the free-living cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120 and used as probes. A
    mixture of Azolla, Anabaena and bacterial DNA was extracted from Azolla
    fronds and digested with two restriction enzymes. Single-copy RFLP signals
    were detected with two of the probes in all Azolla Anabaena examined.
    Multiple-copy RFLP signals were obtained from the third probe which
    corresponded to a part of the nif N gene. A total of 46 probe/enzyme
    combinations were scored as present or absent and used to calculate pairwise
    Nei's genetic distances among symbiotic Anaebaena strains. Phylogenetic
    trees summarizing phenetic and cladistic relationships among strains were
    generated according to three different evolutionary scenarios: parsimony,
    UPGMA and neighbour joining. All trees revealed identical phylogenetic
    relationships. Principal component analysis was also used to evaluate
    genetic similarities and revealed three groups: group one contains the
    cyanobacteria associated with plants from the Azolla section, group two
    contains those associated with plants from the pinnata species and group
    three contains those associated with plants from the nilotica species. The
    same groups had already been identified earlier in a random amplified
    polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis of Azolla-Anbaena DNA complexes, suggesting
    that the present Azolla taxonomy should be revised. We now suggest a
    taxonomy of Anabaena azollae that is parallel to such a revised Azolla
    taxonomy. An Azolla chloroplast DNA sequence derived from Oryza sativa was
    also used as an RFLP probe on Azolla DNA to confirm the presence of plant
    DNA in the total genomic DNA extracted from ferns with or without the
    symbiont. Our results also suggest that total DNA extracted from the
    Azolla-Anabaena complexes includes both plant and symbiont DNA and can be
    used equally well for RFLP analysis of host plant or symbiotic
    cyanobacteria.

    Incorrect labelling of plants in trade and misidentification are widespread.
    Likewise, in trade numerous names are being used for the ornamental aquatic
    plant known as ‘Kariba weed’, but rarely the correct scientific name
    Salvinia molesta Mitch. For inspection services of EPPO member countries,
    correct identification of S. molesta has become important since the species
    was added to the EPPO A2 List and the List of Union concern in accordance
    with EU regulation 1143/2014 based on an EPPO Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) for
    the species. Inspections and a targetted survey of Salvinia plants in trade
    in the Netherlands were performed and additional material was obtained from
    wild sources in South Africa, Hungary and the United States. Specimen
    identification was verified by comparison with the herbarium collection at
    Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden and with the sequences available in
    NCBI GenBank database. This paper provides the tools to correctly identity
    the relevant Salvinia species.

    and an index to collectors’ names and numbers are given for the Neotropical
    taxa belonging to Elaphoglossum Schott ex J. Sm. sect. Squamipedia Mickel &
    Atehortu´ a. Eighteen taxa are recognized herein, consisting of 16 species,
    with one of the species, E. peltatum (Sw.) Urb., having three forms. Three
    new species are described: E. anthracinum A. Vasco, Mickel & R. C. Moran, E.
    blepharis A. Vasco, Mickel & R. C. Moran, and E. rhomboideum A. Vasco,
    Mickel & R. C. Moran. The following name is lectotypified: Acrostichum
    flabellatum Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd. var. sphenophyllum Kunze. Four species
    are atypical in the genus by having divided laminae: E. colombianum (Maxon)
    Mickel and E. moorei (E. Britton) Christ have pinnately divided laminae, E.
    peltatum (Sw.) Urb. has isodichotomously divided laminae, and E. tripartitum
    (Hook. & Grev.) Mickel has ternately divided laminae. The Neotropical
    species of the section can usually be distinguished from other species of
    Elaphoglossum by long-creeping, green rhizomes; thin, translucent, light
    orange or brown rhizome scales; distichous leaves; paired peglike aerophores
    on each side of the rhizome slightly proximal to the petiole bases; a lack
    of phyllopodia; leaves that are typically , 15 cm long; and echinulate
    spores. One species, E. nidiforme Mickel, is atypical by its large size and
    short-creeping rhizomes but is included here in Elaphoglossum sect.
    Squamipedia based on previous molecular phylogenetic analyses. All
    Neotropical species of Elaphoglossum sect. Squamipedia are epiphytes,
    usually in middle- to high-elevation forests. The section is most diverse in
    the Andes from Colombia to Bolivia, where 17 taxa occur.

    The Linnaean species Pteris vittata, commonly known variously as the Chinese
    brake, Chinese ladder brake or simply ladder brake fern of family
    Pteridaceae is indigenous to Asia, tropical Africa and Australia, and its
    type specimen was collected in China by Pehr Osbeck. In recent years it has
    gained world-wide attention for phytoremediation of soils and water bodies
    due its strong ability to hyperaccumulate the metalloid arsenic. This
    article is intended to put forward a strong case for a fresh thorough
    inquiry into the biology and taxonomy of the Pteris vittata species-complex
    in India. The so far reported variation in the species-complex, both
    morphological and cytological, as well as the currently recognized
    subspecies within P. vittata are reviewed, and commented upon, so as to
    impress upon the need to undertake its in-depth study for evaluating its
    total biodiversity in India. Pteris vittata sensu lato is an interesting
    complex wherein lot many surprises are waiting to be discovered, if one gets
    into it wholeheartedly.

    The sex expression of gametophytes of Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Todaro
    was compared in nature and in culture. Plants raised from multispore
    cultures (100 spores/cm
                  2
                  ) exhibited the most variety in sexual–morphological types. Individually raised plants were slower to develop and showed less variety of sexual types than was found in the multispore cultures. There appeared to be a density effect on development. Field-collected gametophytes showed the least diversity, the populations being largely composed of poorly developed male and neuter plants. The experimental and field data are considered in relation to antheridiogen and population density studies.

    After its original description as Woodsia oregana (cathcartiana) x W.

    between W. ilvensis and W. scopulina, on the basis of its scopulina-like
    hairs, which are absent in W. ilvensis and W. oregana. Evidence is presented
    here that the form of the pinnae, glands, indusial segments and sorus, and
    the chromosome number, support the original interpretation of W. ilvensis x

    The striking hybrid fern, Osmunda X ruggii, was described in 1940 by Rolla
    Tryon as the natural cross of O. regalis L. var. spec tab His (Willd.) Gray
    and O. claytoniana L. A single plant was discovered in Connecticut and grown
    in the garden of HG Rugg of Dartmouth College. Until the population
    described below was found, no new localities and no known occurrences of
    this taxon in nature have been reported. It is the only interspecific hybrid
    known in the Osmundaceae, a family conservatively interpreted as comprising
    three genera …

  abstract: >-
    Giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta Mitchell, Salviniaceae) is a free-floating
    fern native to Brazil that alters natural processes in aquatic ecosystems,
    causing ecological problems for water resource managers. Due to its ease of
    dispersal through fragmentation and rapid growth, giant salvinia can quickly
    become problematic, requiring persistent management efforts. If left
    unmanaged, giant salvinia creates a thick mat of vegetation, which limits
    sunlight penetration, reducing aquatic macrophytes, lowering dissolved
    oxygen and stressing aquatic organisms. Giant salvinia was first reported in
    Lago Las Curias, Cupey, San Juan, Puerto Rico, USA, in 2016 and covered the
    entire 19 ha waterbody in 2018. In 2019, we conducted surveys to examine the
    extent of the invasion and quantify ecological damage to the aquatic
    environment. We found that the lake is lacking in dissolved oxygen, with a
    mean concentration of 0.38 mg L-1, and mean concentrations of nitrate,
    ammonium, and phosphate were < 1 mg L-1. Mean pH in 2019 was 6.4, down from
    7.6 in years prior to giant salvinia. We estimated total fresh giant
    salvinia biomass to be 3,449 metric tons and dry biomass to be 51 metric
    tons. Other floating vegetation associated with the giant salvinia mat
    included Pistia stratiotes, Pontederia crassipes, Typha sp., Oxycaryum
    cubense, Cyperus esculentus and Mikania sp. Uncontrolled growth of giant
    salvinia impeded access to the waterbody and degraded resource quality in
    the aquatic ecosystem. The lack of dissolved oxygen and decreasing pH
    creates conditions for sedimentary nutrients release, creating a potential
    internal loading of phosphorus. To control an infestation of this magnitude
    we suggest biological control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous
    salviniae) which has proven successful in controlling giant salvinia, and at
    a fraction of the cost of other control methods. Ultimately, an integrated
    management plan, including chemical and mechanical control, needs to be
    established to control giant salvinia and other invasive freefloating
    plants, and monitor the restoration of ecological services at Lago Las
    Curias. As a long term goal, nutrient fluxes into the lake must be reduced
    by eliminating non-point sources of pollution throughout the watershed.

    Tandem repeats can occupy a large portion of plant genomes and can either
    cause or result from chromosomal rearrangements, which are important drivers
    of dysploidy-mediated karyotype evolution and speciation. To understand the
    contribution of tandem repeats in shaping the extant Senna tora dysploid
    karyotype, we analyzed the composition and abundance of tandem repeats in
    the S. tora genome and compared the chromosomal distribution of these
    repeats between S. tora and a closely related euploid, Senna occidentalis.
    Using a read clustering algorithm, we identiﬁed the major S. tora tandem
    repeats and visualized their chromosomal distribution by ﬂuorescence in situ
    hybridization. We identiﬁed eight independent repeats covering ∼85 Mb or
    ∼12% of the S. tora genome. The unit lengths and copy numbers had ranges of
    7–5,833 bp and 325–2.89 × 106, respectively. Three short duplicated
    sequences were found in the 45S rDNA intergenic spacer, one of which was
    also detected at an extra-NOR locus. The canonical plant telomeric repeat
    (TTTAGGG)n was also detected as very intense signals in numerous
    pericentromeric and interstitial loci. StoTR05_180, which showed
    subtelomeric distribution in Senna occidentalis, was predominantly
    pericentromeric in S. tora. The unusual chromosomal distribution of tandem
    repeats in S. tora not only enabled easy identiﬁcation of individual
    chromosomes but also revealed the massive chromosomal rearrangements that
    have likely played important roles in shaping its dysploid karyotype.

    Chromosome numbers and reproductive biology of nine species of the fern
    genus Hypodematium (Hypodematiaceae) from China were investigated. The
    chromosome numbers of eight species are reported here for the first time: H.
    daochengensis n=41 (41 II); H. fordii n=40 (40 II), n=80 (40 II+40 I),
    2n=120; H. glanduloso-pilosum n=41 (41 II), 2n=82, 2n=123; H. gracile n=41
    (41 II); H. hirsutum n= 41 (41 II); H. microleptoides n=41 (41 II); H.
    sinense n= 40 (40 II) and H. squamuloso-pilosum n=41 (41 II). Two cytotypes,
    n=82 (41 II+41 I) and 2n=123 in H. crenatum, are reported for the first
    time. Our results showed that the species with these cytotypes are
    agamospermous triploids: H. crenatum n = 82 (41 II +41 I), H.
    glanduloso-pilosum n = 82 (41 II +41 I) and H. fordii n = 80 (40 II +40 I),
    based on the unequal size and presence of aborted spores in the sporangium,
    and the allotriploid hybrid chromosomes in the spore mother cell at the
    diakinesis stage of meiosis I. The remaining species are sexual diploids and
    tetraploids, based on the chromosome number n = 41 and n =82 at the
    diakinesis stage of meiosis I of spore mother cells. The relationships among
    habitat preferences, frond hairs and reproductive modes in Hypodematium are
    discussed and illustrated. It appears that plants with large fronds and
    sparse, thin hairs, living in humid and shady places undergo sexual
    reproduction, while small plants living in sunny and dry conditions with
    thick hairs undergo agamospermous reproduction. The distribution pattern and
    basic chromosome number all indicated the basic chromosome number x= 41 was
    plesiomorphic, whereas x=40 was apomorphic. Chromosome aneuploid changes
    occurred in this genus. The distribution of the sexual diploids and
    tetraploids and agamospermous triploids suggests that the genus might have
    originated in the Himalayas and dispersed from there to northeast Asia and
    Japan.

    BackgroundThere are different opinions about the relationship of two
    disjunctively distributed varieties Adiantum reniforme L. var. sinense
    Y.X.Lin and Adiantum reniforme L. Adiantum reniforme var. sinense is an
    endangered fern only distributed in a narrowed region of Chongqing city in
    China, while Adiantum reniforme var. reniforme just distributed in Canary
    Islands and Madeira off the north-western African coast. To verify the
    relationship of these two taxa, relative phylogenetic analyses, karyotype
    analyses, microscopic spore observations and morphological studies were
    performed in this study. Besides, divergence time between A. reniforme var.
    sinense and A. reniforme var. reniforme was estimated using GTR model
    according to a phylogeny tree constructed with the three cpDNA markers atpA,
    atpB, and rbcL.ResultsPhylogenetic results and divergence time analyses--all
    individuals of A. reniforme var. sinense from 4 different populations
    (representing all biogeographic distributions) were clustered into one clade
    and all individuals of A. reniforme var. reniforme from 7 different
    populations (all biogeographic distributions are included) were clustered
    into another clade. The divergence between A. reniforme var. reniforme and
    A. reniforme var. sinense was estimated to be 4.94 (2.26-8.66) Myr. Based on
    karyotype analyses, A. reniforme var. reniforme was deduced to be hexaploidy
    with 2n¿=¿180, X¿=¿30, while A. reniforme var. sinense was known as
    tetraploidy. Microscopic spore observations suggested that surface
    ornamentation of A. reniforme var. reniforme is psilate, but that of A.
    reniforme var. sinense is rugate. Leaf blades of A. reniforme var. sinense
    are membranous and reniform and with several obvious concentric rings, and
    leaves of A. reniforme var. reniforme are pachyphyllous and coriaceous and
    are much rounder and similar to palm.Conclusion Adiantum reniforme var.
    sinense is an independent species rather than the variety of Adiantum
    reniforme var. reniforme. As a result, we approve Adiantum nelumboides X. C.
    Zhang, nom. &amp; stat. nov. as a legal name instead of the former Adiantum
    reniforme var. sinense. China was determined to be the most probable
    evolution centre based on the results of phylogenetic analyses, divergence
    estimation, relative palaeogeography and palaeoclimate materials.

    The growth of 22 strains of Azolla pinnata R. Br., 3 strains of A.
    filiculoides Lam. and one strain each of A. mexicana Presl and A.
    caroliniana Willd. was tested separately in liquid culture media kept in
    controlled, artificial light (30 klux) growth cabinets. Three temperature
    levels were used: 33°C (37/29°C day/night), 29°C (33/25°C) and 22°C
    (26/18°C)/ Photoperiod was 12 h a day. For most A. pinnata strains (except
    three) and an A. mexicana strain the maximum weekly relative growth rate was
    higher at 33°C than at 22°C, but not for A. filiculoides and A. caroliniana.
    The highest value of maximum relative growth rate corresponded to 1.9
    doubling days and in most strains this occurred in the first week. As the
    plants grew, the growth rate slowed down more severely at higher
    temperatures. The maximum biomass was higher at 22°C than at 33°C in all
    strains. At 22°C, it took 30-50 days to attain maximum biomass and the
    highest value was 14 g N m-2or 320 g dry m-2by A. caroliniana, followed by
    12 g N m-2or 290 g dry wt. m-2by one strain of A. filiculoides. At 29°C, the
    maximum biomass was attained in 20-35 days. The highest value was 6.3 g N
    m-2or 154 g dry wt. m-2by A. caroliniana. At 33°C, most A. pinnata strains
    gave a maximum biomass of less than 4 g N m-2after 13-23 days, while some
    strains grew up to 30 days, resulting in a higher maximum biomass. The
    highest maximum biomass at 33°C was 5.5 g N m-2or 140 g m-2dry wt. by A.
    pinnata from Cheng Mai while the maximum biomass of A. filiculoides and A.
    caroliniana was much less. Azolla filiculoides requires lower temperature
    than other species for its growth. Azolla pinnata has the best tolerance to
    high temperatures among the four species. Azolla mexicana could not be
    discriminated from A. pinnata in its response to temperature. Azolla
    caroliniana may keep an intermediate position between A. filiculoides and A.
    pinnata in temperature response. The formation of ammonia in the medium was
    examined and it occurred mostly under stationary growth conditions, but, at
    33°C, some strains of A. pinnata and A. mexicana released or formed ammonia
    at 0.3-0.8 μg N ml-1per week during their initial exponential growth stage.

    The Cretaceous period saw dramatic shifts in the functional plant biology of
    the Earth’s ﬂora. This was an episode of explosive plant radiations that
    produced our modern angiosperm-dominated world. This period was also a time
    of great Pteridophytic diversiﬁcation and experimentation and saw the rise
    of most extant fern lineages. Prominent among these was the widespread
    appearance of epiphytic species. In modern tropical forest canopies,
    epiphytic ferns often represent some of the most abundant taxa and can
    dominate epiphyte biomass. Yet from most perspectives, the epiphytic habitat
    is vastly different from the forest ﬂoor. What happened during the
    Cretaceous that led to such widespread epiphyte fern diversiﬁcation? What
    are the traits that allow extant ferns to ﬂourish in this dry,
    nutrient-poor, bright habitat? How did terrestrial ferns cope with this new
    habitat? We review a number of functional aspects of fern biology to include
    both gametophytic and sporophytic physiology. It is possible that
    angiosperms engineered conditions that lead to aseasonal tropical forests.
    Data suggest that ferns may have reduced water use efﬁciency. If so, then
    wetter forests may have facilitated fern diversiﬁcation. Successful
    epiphytic species would have required major modiﬁcation in the gametophyte
    generation to include indeterminate growth, extreme stress tolerance, and an
    outcrossing breeding system. Terrestrial species also radiated at this time
    and may have relied on unique aspects of photobiology to take advantage of
    low-light terrestrial habitats. The study of fern ecology has reached a
    fevered pitch. Continued investigation will no doubt reveal some of the most
    exciting changes in our understanding of this remarkable lineage.

    Methods: We undertook a cytogeographic study across the range of the genus,
    using a combination of chromosome counts and ﬂow cytometry to infer ploidy
    level. Bioclimatic variables and elevation were used to compare niches.

    Results: We found that diploids and tetraploids are common and widespread,
    and triploids are rare and sporadic; in contrast with genome size inferences
    in earlier studies, no hexaploids were found. Diploids and tetraploids show
    diﬀerent geographic ranges: only tetraploids were found in the northernmost
    portion of the range (Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia) and only
    diploids were found in the Sierra Nevada of California. Diploid, triploid,
    and tetraploid cytotypes were found to co‐occur in relatively few
    localities: in the southern (San Diego County, California) and desert
    Southwest (Arizona) parts of the range, and along the Paciﬁc Coast of
    California.

    Conclusions: Tetraploids occupy a wider bioclimatic niche than diploids both
    within P. triangularis and at the genus‐wide scale. It is unknown whether
    the wider niche of tetraploids is due to their expansion upon the diploid
    niche, if diploids have contracted their niche due to competition or
    changing abiotic conditions, or if this wider niche occupancy is due to
    multiple origins of tetraploids.

    Cystoathyrium chinense Ching, the sole representative of Cystoathyrium, is a
    critically endangered species endemic to China with no more than 40 extant
    individuals. Until now, its systematic position and relationships among
    leptosporangiate ferns remained unknown. The present study assessed the
    phylogenetic relationships of Cystoathyrium chinense with potential
    relatives densely sampled using three chloroplast DNA markers (matK, rbcL,
    and trnG-R intergenic spacer). Our results support the inclusion of
    Cystoathyrium in Cystopteris. A hybrid origin hypothesis of Cystoathyrium
    chinense is neither supported nor rejected by the present study. According
    to our ancestral area reconstruction analysis, the disjunct distribution of
    Cystoathyrium and its closely related North American taxa may be attributed
    to the long-distance dispersal via Beringia from Asia to North America.
    Consequently, a new combination (Cystopteris chinensis comb. nov.) is made,
    and the description is supplemented based on our new observations in the
    field.

    Aim Gondwanan vicariance, boreotropical migration and long-distance
    dispersal have been posited as alternative hypotheses explaining the
    tropical distribution patterns and diversiﬁcations in many fern groups.
    Here, the historical biogeography of Diplazium is reconstructed to evaluate
    the impact of these biogeographical processes in shaping the modern tropical
    disjunctions.

    Abstract
                
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. comprises ca. 60 species with a disjunct Africa/Asia and Australia distribution. The infrageneric classification of
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. is controversial based on the phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast markers and morphology. Based on the expanded taxon sampling of
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. (51 species), we investigated its phylogeny, biogeography, character evolution and environmental adaptation by employing five chloroplastid markers (
                  rbc
                  L,
                  mat

                  trn
                  S) and one single (low)-copy nuclear gene,
                  LEAFY
                  .
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. was divided into six major clades and eight subclades. Reticulate evolution was revealed both among clades and among species in
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. Ancestral character state optimization revealed high levels of homoplastic evolution of the diagnostic characters in
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l., while the crassulacean acid metabolism pathway seems to have an independent origin. Molecular dating and biogeographic diversification analyses suggested that
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. originated no later than the Oligocene and the main clades diversified during the Oligocene and Miocene, with southern Asia, the Indo-China Peninsula and southwestern and southern China as the most likely ancestral areas. Transoceanic long-distance dispersal, rather than vicariance, contributed to the intercontinental disjunction. Diversification scenarios of
                  Pyrrosia
                  s.l. under geological movements and climate fluctuation are also discussed.

    T. he Appalachian Asplenium complex consists of six fertile species: three
    diploids and their three allotetraploid derivatives. This reticulate
    evolutionary pattern, originally proposed on the basis of morphological and
    cytological evidence, was later corroborated by analyses of flavonoid
    composition. Presented here are data from starch gel electrophoresis of 11
    enzyme systems, coded by 15 interpretable loci, which are highly consistent
    with the proposed relationships in the Appalachian Asplenium complex. The
    diploids are strongly differentiated (genetic distance (D) = 0.67 to 1.30);
    each diploid possesses unique alleles at several loci. Each allotetraploid
    expresses the heterozygous, or less often homozygous, enzyme phenotypes
    expected for combinations of parental alleles at most loci. Exceptions are
    the expression of a novel PGI-2 allele and the loss of expression of
    parental IDH alleles in both allotetsaploids.

    A large proportion of plant species has originated through allopolyploidy:
    interspeciJic hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. Heterozygosity
    remains fixed in allopolyploids because of nonsegregation of parental
    chromosomes. Two allotetraploid species of the fern genus Asplenium show
    allozyme polymorphisms a t loci that are polymorphic in their diploid
    progenitors, indicating that each has originated more than once and
    implicating continued gene flowfrom diploids to tetraploids.

  abstract: >-
    Schizaeaceae fossils have been documented throughout Mesozoic and Cenozoic
    deposits, but our understanding of this fossil record is hampered by
    uncertainties with respect to the relationships of living species. To start
    building a phylogenetic framework for the family, an initial phylogenetic
    analysis of living species using plastid rbcL nucleotide sequence data is
    conducted. The analysis supports Schizaea s. lat. and Lygodium monophyly,
    but Anemia is resolved as paraphyletic to Mohria. In the Anemia/Mohria
    clade, monophyly of subgenus Anemiorrhiza is supported, but Coptophyllum is
    resolved as paraphyletic to subgenus Anemia. In Schizaea s. lat., both
    Schizaea s. str. and Actinostachys are well supported and Microschizaea is
    grouped with Schizaea s. str., although only one Microschizaea species
    (Schizaea pusilla) was included. These results are largely congruent with
    previous morphology-based analyses. In Lygodium however, results presented
    contrast with recent morphological analyses highlighting the problems of
    identifying Lygodium subgeneric groups. Using the resulting phylogeny as a
    framework, putative relationships of fossil species are discussed, tentative
    minimum age estimates for generic crown group diversifications are made, and
    possible conclusions with respect to the origins of habit and habitat
    preferences are discussed. The fossil evidence indicates that subgeneric
    groups within the Anemia/Mohria clade are comparatively ancient, originating
    during the Early Cretaceous, and the putative placement of fossil Anemia
    within the crown group of living subgenus Anemiorrhiza would indicate that
    their calcareous habitat preference may be a relic feature that has
    persisted ever since the Early Cretaceous. Lygodium on the other hand
    appears to have passed through a diversity bottleneck. Modern species
    diversity probably originated in the Neogene, and the earliest fossil
    evidence for the origin of their vining and trailing habit comes from the
    placement of Miocene fossil Lygodium within the crown group of living
    species. ß 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

    On the basis of a critical examination of the type collections of all taxa
    described in Arabis and Boechera from North America, we propose the
    following nomenclatural adjustments among the sexual diploid taxa. Seven new
    species of Boechera (B. evadens, B. rollinsiorum, B. serpenticola, B.
    shevockii, B. texana, B. ultraalsa, B. villosa) are described and new names
    are proposed for the taxa originally described as A. pulchra var. munciensis
    (B. lincolnensis) and A. breweri var. austinae (B. breweri ssp.
    shastaensis). Ten new combinations (B. arcuata, B. atrorubens, B.
    fernaldiana ssp. vivariensis, B. formosa, B. howellii, B. nevadensis, B.
    paupercula, B. pendulocarpa, B. polyanthua, B. spatifolia) are validated.
    Notes on the delimitation, distribution, and/or typification of B.
    davidsonii, B. holboellii, B. johnstonii, B. lignifera, B. lyallii, B.
    microphylla, B. pallidifolia, B. pendulina, B. retrofracta, B. sparsiflora,
    and B. subpinnatifida are presented, with the last species reported for the
    first time from Idaho, Nevada, and Utah. Arabis davidsonii var. parva, A.
    demissa, A. hirshbergiae, and A. thompsonii are reduced to synonymy under B.
    davidsonii, B. oxylobula, B. johnstonii, and B. pallidifolia, respectively.

  abstract: >-
    The ferns are an ancient group of vascular plants that have yielded a
    staggering array of systematic problems. Among fern classifications, the
    number of genera in some families has ranged over 10-fold, and some genera
    have been treated in up to five different families. Three main groups of
    leptosporangiate ferns have been recognized: the adiantoid, polypodioid, and
    dennstaedtioid lines. To clarify relationships among genera and families of
    dennstaedtioid ferns, we sequenced 1320 bp of the chloroplast gene rbcL from
    45 species representing 13 families. Sequence divergence for rbcL averaged
    0.9% among species within genera, 10.3% among genera within families, and
    14.8% among families, suggesting that the data are appropriate for
    phylogenetic analysis at the generic and familial levels in ferns. Maximum
    parsimony analysis resulted in four shortest trees of equal length. The
    strict consensus tree supported many aspects of previously published
    hypotheses of relationship based on morphological and cytological
    variations. For example, the tree ferns (which form a single clade) and
    Hymenophyllaceae appear as sister groups to the dennstaedtioid ferns on all
    shortest trees. However, Polypodiaceae and adiantoid ferns, groups
    traditionally considered separate from the dennstaedtioid families, emerged
    within the dennstaedtioid clade. This analysis also suggests relationships
    of some problematical genera, such as Monachosorum, Calochlaena, and
    Lonchitis. Examination of additional DNA sequences of nuclear genes and
    developmental studies are needed to evaluate further the relationships
    suggested by phylogenetic analysis of rbcL sequence data.

    © The Author(s) 2015. Ferns are one of the few remaining major clades of
    land plants for which a complete genome sequence is lacking. Knowledge of
    genome space in ferns will enable broad-scale comparative analyses of land
    plant genes and genomes, provide insights into genome evolution across green
    plants, and shed light on genetic and genomic features that characterize
    ferns, such as their high chromosome numbers and large genome sizes. As part
    of an initial exploration into fern genome space, we used a whole genome
    shotgun sequencing approach to obtain low-density coverage (∼0.4X to 2X) for
    six fern species from the Polypodiales (Ceratopteris, Pteridium, Polypodium,
    Cystopteris), Cyatheales (Plagiogyria), and Gleicheniales (Dipteris). We
    explore these data to characterize the proportion of the nuclear genome
    represented by repetitive sequences (including DNA transposons,
    retrotransposons, ribosomal DNA, and simple repeats) and protein-coding
    genes, and to extract chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences. Such
    initial sweeps of fern genomescan provide information useful for selecting a
    promising candidate fern species for whole genome sequencing. Wealso
    describe variation of genomic traits across our sample and highlight some
    differences and similarities in repeat structure between ferns and seed
    plants.

    © 2018 Wolf et al. Applications in Plant Sciences is published by Wiley
    Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the Botanical Society of America Premise of
    the Study: Until recently, most phylogenetic studies of ferns were based on
    chloroplast genes. Evolutionary inferences based on these data can be
    incomplete because the characters are from a single linkage group and are
    uniparentally inherited. These limitations are particularly acute in studies
    of hybridization, which is prevalent in ferns; fern hybrids are common and
    ferns are able to hybridize across highly diverged lineages, up to 60
    million years since divergence in one documented case. However, it not yet
    clear what effect such hybridization has on fern evolution, in part due to a
    paucity of available biparentally inherited (nuclear-encoded) markers.
    Methods: We designed oligonucleotide baits to capture 25 targeted, low-copy
    nuclear markers from a sample of 24 species spanning extant fern diversity.
    Results: Most loci were successfully sequenced from most accessions.
    Although the baits were designed from exon (transcript) data, we
    successfully captured intron sequences that should be useful for more
    focused phylogenetic studies. We present phylogenetic analyses of the new
    target sequence capture data and integrate these into a previous
    transcript-based data set. Discussion: We make our bait sequences available
    to the community as a resource for further studies of fern phylogeny.

    Two East Asian

                  (Lomariopsidaceae, Polypodiales) species,
                  Lomariopsis moorei
                  and
                  Lomariopsis longini
                  , which were previously misidentified as
                  L. spectabilis
                  , are here described as new species based on evidence from morphological characters and a molecular phylogeny. The two species differ from the three other described species in East Asia by their venation, pinna shapes, and perine morphology. A phylogeny based on a combined dataset of three chloroplast regions (
                  rbcL
                  +
                  rps4-trnS

                  trnL-L-F
                  ) showed that
                  L. moorei
                  and
                  L. longini
                  each formed a well-supported monophyletic group which was distantly related to both
                  L. spectabilis
                  and the other morphologically similar East Asian species,
                  L. boninensis
                  .

  abstract: >-
    Although considerable progress has recently been made in the phylogeny of
    Hymenasplenium, the genus remains poorly investigated; speciﬁcally, the
    diversiﬁcation and historical biogeography of the genus have been little
    studied. Here, we infer an updated plastid DNA phylogeny and the ﬁrst
    large‐scale nuclear DNA phylogeny to understand the biogeography of the
    genus. The plastid phylogeny includes 312 accessions from across the genus′
    distribution range (ca. 121% increase of the latest sampling), with special
    attention paid to island accessions from 14 Indian Ocean and Paciﬁc islands,
    whereas the nuclear phylogeny includes 161 accessions of the Afro–Eurasian
    species. We identify one new major clade and two new subclades. Reticulate
    evolution was revealed both among subclades and among species in the
    Afro–Eurasian. Our divergence‐time analyses show that most of the extant
    species diversity has arisen from diversiﬁcation after the Oligocene despite
    a Cretaceous origin of the genus. Ancestral area reconstruction revealed
    that vicariance likely played a major role in building biogeographic
    patterns at deep evolutionary scales (the Afro–Eurasian clade and the
    American clade) in Hymenasplenium, while the intercontinental disjunctions
    within the Afro–Eurasian clade among Asia, Africa, and Oceania might have
    resulted from frequent long‐distance dispersal events from Asia to Oceania
    and Africa.

    Abstract Hybridization, polyploidization, and reticulate evolution are major
    mechanisms that shape the current fern diversity. Based on molecular
    phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast DNA (psbA-trnH, trnG-trnR) and low-copy
    nuclear DNA (gapCp) sequences and flow cytometric analysis, we attempt to
    clarify the origin of putative Nephrolepis hybrids and cultivars. Our
    results confirm the presence of several hybrids, among which Nephrolepis

    Agriculture faces mounting challenges from climate change, soil degradation,
    and unsustainable agrochemical use, highlighting the need for eco-friendly
    solutions.
                  Azolla
                  , a fast-growing aquatic fern, has emerged as a multifunctional resource for sustainable farming and climate resilience. Through its symbiosis with
                  Anabaena azollae
                  , it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing dependence on synthetic fertilizers and improving soil health.
                  Azolla
                  also serves as a protein-rich feed for livestock and aquaculture, suppresses weeds and pests in rice systems, and supports water conservation. Beyond agriculture, it contributes to carbon sequestration, mitigates methane emissions, and shows promise in wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and as a feedstock for biofuels and bioplastics. However, large-scale adoption is limited by challenges such as short shelf life, ecological risks, and preservation constraints. This review synthesizes current knowledge on
                  Azolla
                  , emphasizing its biological and ecological functions, highlights practical applications across agriculture, livestock, aquaculture, and environmental management, and outlines key research priorities needed to overcome limitations and enable its integration into climate-smart agricultural and environmental systems.

  abstract: >-
    The urban streams in the Amazon are experiencing eutrophication due to
    sewage discharge, which threatens the diversity and abundance of aquatic
    fauna, as well as human health. Macrophytes have the ability to absorb high
    nitrogen compounds from the water. Little is known about the decontamination
    effects of Amazonian macrophyte species. This study aims to evaluate the
    physicochemical variables of water from an urban stream after treatment with
    native macrophytes. The experiment was conducted at the Federal Institute of
    Amazonas, Tabatinga Campus. Two hundred liters of water were collected from
    the Buriti stream, near the municipal public landfill. The polluted water
    was transferred to 20-liter aquariums in duplicates, and the treatments used
    were four species of floating macrophytes: Pistia stratiotes, Salvinia
    auriculata, Azolla filiculoides, and Eichhornia azurea. The macrophyte
    density used in the aquariums was 20 ± 1 g l-1. Dissolved oxygen, pH, total
    ammonia, nitrite, conductivity, dissolved solids, and aquarium temperature
    were monitored over seven days. The eutrophic water treated with the four
    experimental macrophyte species showed a reduction in total nitrite and an
    increase in pH within 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Eichhornia azurea
    decreased electrical conductivity and total solids in the water within 24
    and 48 hours, respectively. Pistia stratiotes was the macrophyte with the
    greatest reduction in total ammonia. Salvinia auriculata was the only
    experimental species that did not reduce total ammonia in the water.
    Overall, Eichhornia azurea, followed by Pistia stratiotes, were the most
    efficient macrophytes for water treatment, altering pH, electrical
    conductivity, total dissolved solids, ammonia, and total nitrite. In this
    sense, the macrophytes Eichhornia azurea and Pistia stratiotes can be
    biological alternatives for the treatment and improvement of the
    physicochemical variables of water in an eutrophic environment.

    The brake fern genus Pteris belongs to the Pteridaceae subfamily
    Pteridoideae. It contains 200–250 species distributed on all continents
    except Antarctica, with its highest species diversity in tropical and
    subtropical regions. The monophyly of Pteris has long been in question
    because of its great morphological diversity and because of the
    controversial relationships of the Australian endemic monospeciﬁc genus
    Platyzoma. The circumscription of the Pteridoideae has likewise been
    uncertain. Previous studies typically had sparse sampling of Pteris species
    and related genera and used limited DNA sequence data. In the present study,
    DNA sequences of six plastid loci of 146 accessions representing 119 species
    of Pteris (including the type of the genus) and 18 related genera were used
    to infer a phylogeny using maximum-likelihood, Bayesian-inference and
    maximum-parsimony methods. Our major results include: (i) the previous
    uncertain relationships of Platyzoma were due to long-branch attraction;
    (ii) Afropteris, Neurocallis, Ochropteris and Platyzoma are all embedded
    within a well-supported Pteris sensu lato; (iii) the traditionally
    circumscribed Jamesonia is paraphyletic in relation to a monophyletic
    Eriosorus; (iv) Pteridoideae contains 15 genera: Actiniopteris, Anogramma,
    Austrogramme, Cerosora, Cosentinia, Eriosorus, Jamesonia, Nephopteris (no
    molecular data), Onychium, Pityrogramma, Pteris, Pterozonium, Syngramma,
    Taenitis and Tryonia; and (v) 15 well-supported clades within Pteris are
    identiﬁed, which differ from one another on molecular, morphological and
    geographical grounds, and represent 15 major evolutionary lineages.

    © International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) 2016. The
    circumscription and the phylogeny of the fern family Tectariaceae have been
    controversial. Previous molecular studies have supported the monophyly of
    this family, with 4-5 genera. However, these studies were exclusively based
    on plastid markers and relatively small sampling, especially of the
    non-Tectaria genera. In the present study, DNA sequences of eight plastid
    and one nuclear markers of 25 accessions representing 19 species of Tectaria
    and 58 accessions representing ca. 90% of the non-Tectaria species in the
    family (including Arthropteris) were used to infer a phylogeny using maximum
    likelihood (ML), Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony. Our major
    results include: (1) Tectaria as currently circumscribed is not monophyletic
    and can be divided into three genera: Tectaria s.str., Draconopteris (gen.
    nov.) from Central to South America, and Malaifilix (gen. nov.) from
    Malesia; (2) Draconopteris and Malaifilix, the two new genera, together with
    Pteridrys, form a strongly supported clade; (3) in our ML analyses, the
    clade containing Draconopteris, Malaifilix, and Pteridrys (the DMP clade) is
    resolved as sister to the rest of Tectariaceae and Arthropteris is sister to
    Tectaria + (Hypoderris + Triplophyllum), suggesting that Arthropteris should
    be treated as a member of Tectariaceae, and thus Tectariaceae contains seven
    genera: Arthropteris, Draconopteris, Hypoderris, Malaifilix, Pteridrys,
    Tectaria, and Triplophyllum; (4) with the well-supported relationships among
    the members of Tectariaceae, anastomosing venation in the family is inferred
    to have evolved independently at least three times; (5) Nephrolepis is
    strongly supported as sister to a clade containing Cyclopeltis,
    Dracoglossum, and Lomariopsis, and thus we advocate that Lomariopsidaceae
    include these four genera (plus the unsampled Thysanosoria); and (6)
    intercontinental dispersal appears to have played an important role in
    shaping the extant distribution of Tectariaceae.

    Tectaria (Tectariaceae) is one of the most confusing fern genera in terms of
    its circumscription and phylogeny. Since its original description, a number
    of genera had been moved into or related with this genus, while others had
    been segregated from it. Tectaria is also among the largest fern genera,
    comprising 150–210 mostly tropical species. Previous molecular studies have
    been far from comprehensive (sampling no more than 76 accessions from 52
    species), limited in geographic scope (mainly restricted to Asia), and based
    exclusively on plastid markers. In the present study, DNA sequences of eight
    plastid and one nuclear marker of 360 accessions representing ca. 130
    species of Tectaria, ca. 36 species of six nonTectaria genera in
    Tectariaceae, 12 species of Davalliaceae, Oleandraceae, and Polypodiaceae,
    and 13 species of Lomariopsidaceae were used to infer a phylogeny with
    maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony approaches.
    Our major results include: (1) the most recently proposed circumscription of
    Tectaria is strongly supported as monophyletic; (2) the genera Lenda,
    Microbrochis, Phlebiogonium, and Sagenia, sampled here for the ﬁrst time,
    are resolved as part of Tectaria; (3) four superclades representing early
    splits in Tectaria are identiﬁed, with the Old World species being sister to
    the New World species; (4) 12 well-supported major clades in Tectaria are
    revealed, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and
    geographical features; (5) evolution of 13 morphological characters is
    inferred in a phylogenetic context and morphological synapomorphies of
    various clades are identiﬁed; and in particular (6) free venation in
    Tectaria is inferred to be repeatedly derived from anastomosing venation, an
    evolutionary phenomenon not documented previously in vascular plants in a
    phylogenetic context based on both plastid and nuclear evidence.

    As the second most genera-rich fern family, Pteridaceae contain more than
    1000 species contributing to ca. 10% of extant leptosporangiate fern
    diversity. The subfamily Pteridoideae is one of the five subfamilies often
    recognized. The circumscription of Pteridoideae has not been clear. A large
    number of species have not yet been included in any molecular analyses
    before. In this study, DNA sequences of six plastid loci of 154 accessions
    representing ca. 87 species in 14 genera of Pteridaceae subfam. Pteridoideae
    and four accessions representing two species in subfam. Parkerioideae and
    one species of subfam. Adiantoideae as outgroups were used to infer a
    phylogeny using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Our analyses show
    that (1) Pteridoideae is monophyletic and the newly defined subfamily is
    composed of 14 genera including a newly described genus; (2) Pteridoideae is
    resolved into four strongly supported monophyletic clades: the Pteris clade,
    the Actiniopteris + Onychium clade, the JAPSTT clade, and the GAPCC clade,
    these being supported by not only molecular data but also morphological
    features and distribution information; (3) Onychium is confirmed as
    monophyletic and accessions of Onychium are resolved into two strongly
    supported clades, the O. cryptogrammoides clade and the O. siliculosum
    clade; and (4) Accessions of the traditionally defined Anogramma are
    resolved as paraphyletic in relation to Cerosora, Cosentinica, and
    Pityrogramma. Three species traditionally treated in Anogramma are in fact
    more closely related to Cerosora and Pityrogramma than they are to
    Anogramma. Gastoniella Li Bing Zhang & Liang Zhang, gen. nov. is described
    to accommodate these species and three new combinations are provided. Three
    currently known species of Gastoniella are distributed in the Ascension
    Island in South Atlantic Ocean, central Mexico, and tropical America,
    respectively. The new genus is distinct from Anogramma s.s. in having
    ultimate segments linear not obviously broadening toward the upper portion.

  abstract: >-
    The family Onocleaceae represents a small family of terrestrial ferns, with
    four genera and around five species. It has a circumboreal to north
    temperate distribution, and exhibits a disjunct distribution between Eurasia
    and North America, including Mexico. Historically, the taxonomy and
    classification of this family has been subject to debate and contention
    among scholars, leading to contradictory classifications and disagreements
    on the number of genera and species within the family. Furthermore, due to
    this disjunct intercontinental distribution and the lack of detailed study
    across its wide range, this family merits further study to clarify its
    distributional pattern. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic
    reconstructions were based on a concatenated sequence dataset for 17 plastid
    loci and one nuclear locus, which were generated from 106 ingroup and six
    outgroup taxa from three families. Phylogenetic analyses support that
    Onocleaceae is composed of four main clades, and Pentarhizidium was
    recovered as the first branching lineages in Onocleaceae. Molecular dating
    and ancestral area reconstruction analyses suggest that the stem group of
    Onocleaceae originated in Late Cretaceous, with subsequent diversification
    and establishment of the genera Matteuccia, Onoclea, Onocleopsis, and
    Pentarhizidium during the Paleogene and Neogene. The ancestors of
    Matteuccia, Onoclea, and Onocleopsis could have migrated to North America
    via the Beringian land bridge or North Atlantic land bridge which suggests
    that the diversification of Matteuccia + Onoclea + Onocleopsis closely
    aligns with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). In addition, these
    results suggest that Onocleaceae species diversity peaks during the late
    Neogene to Quaternary. Studies such as this enhance our understanding of the
    mechanisms and climatic conditions shaping disjunct distribution in ferns
    and lycophytes of eastern Asia, North America, and Mexico and contribute to
    a growing body of evidence from other taxa, to advance our understanding of
    the origins and migration of plants across continents.

    The pellaeid ferns constitute a monophyletic, xeric-adapted lineage in the
    large fern family Pteridaceae. Previous studies, with relatively small taxon
    and character sampling, resolved the major relationships in the pellaeid
    ferns and found the most species-rich genus, Pellaea, to be polyphyletic. In
    this study, DNA sequences of nine plastid markers of 149 accessions of the
    pellaeids representing ca. 61 (73% of total) species and 71 accessions
    representing ca. 40 species of Myriopteris were used to reconstruct a new
    phylogeny. All major relationships in the pellaeids are well resolved and
    strongly supported. Pellaea is confirmed to be polyphyletic. Based on their
    phylogeny, morphology, and distribution, we propose to recognize eight
    genera, all now monophyletic, in the pellaeids. These new and revised
    circumscriptions result in a monophyletic Pellaea s. str.; they also include
    one resurrected and recircumscribed genus, Paraceterach, and two small new
    genera, Kirkpatrickia and Windhamia, with one and three species,
    respectively.

    Subfamily Microsoroideae represent the third largest subfamily within
    Polypodiaceae. However, due to insufﬁcient sampling, limited informative
    sites and considerable morphological diversiﬁcation, the generic-level
    classiﬁcation within Microsoroideae has been contentious. Furthermore, the
    origin and diversiﬁcation history of this subfamily remain unclear. With the
    most extensive sampling to date, we provide a comprehensive and systematic
    elucidation of the evolutionary history of Microsoroideae. Our key ﬁndings
    include the following: (1) Microsoroideae can be divided into 5 superclades
    and 17 fully supported clades based on the plastome dataset, while nuclear
    gene dataset supports the division of Microsoroideae into 6 superclades and
    19 monophyletic clades; (2) signiﬁcant cytonuclear discordance and gene tree
    conﬂicts exist within Microsoroideae and can be explained by incomplete
    lineage sorting—particularly regarding the conﬂicting phylogenetic positions
    of Bosmania, and introgressive hybridization; (3) molecular dating
    consistently indicates that Microsoroideae originated in the early Eocene
    and began to diversify around the middle Eocene; (4) ancestral area
    reconstruction supports the Asian continent as both the origin and
    diversiﬁcation centres of Microsoroideae; (5) paleoenvironmental changes,
    geological events and a series of dispersal and vicariance events are the
    primary drivers of the current distribution of Microsoroideae; (6)
    diversiﬁcation rate analyses reveal that abrupt changes in the
    diversiﬁcation rate of the maternal lineages of Microsoroideae are
    associated with the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum; (7) nuclear gene data
    show that the diversiﬁcation rate of the Lecanopteris clade is signiﬁcantly
    higher than other clades, which is linked to its unique ant-associated
    traits; and (8) the diversiﬁcation rates of Microsoroideae inferred from
    nuclear gene data exhibit different trends compared with those inferred from
    plastome data. This discrepancy may arise from frequent hybridization and
    polyploidization, which buffer environmental pressures. The ﬁndings not only
    have signiﬁcant implications for the classiﬁcation of Microsoroideae but
    also provide insights for the adaptive evolution of ferns.

    We report the chloroplast genomes of a tree fern (Dicksonia squarrosa) and a
    “fern ally” (Tmesipteris elongata), and show that the phylogeny of early
    land plants is basically as expected, and the estimates of divergence time
    are largely unaffected after removing the fastest evolving sites. The tree
    fern shows themajor reduction in the rate of evolution, and there has been
    amajor slowdown in the rate of mutation in both families of tree ferns.We
    suggest that this is related to a generation time effect; if there is a long
    time period between generations, then this is probably incompatible with a
    high mutation rate because otherwise nearly every propagule would probably
    have several lethal mutations. This effect will be especially strong in
    organisms that have large numbers of cell divisions between generations.
    This shows the necessity of going beyond phylogeny and integrating its study
    with other properties of organisms.

    Whole-genome duplication has been recognized as a major process in
    speciation of land plants, especially in ferns. Whereas genome downsizing
    contributes greatly to the post-genome shock responses of polyploid
    flowering plants, diploidization of polyploid ferns diverges by maintaining
    most of the duplicated DNA and is thus expected to be dominated by genic
    processes. As a consequence, fern genomes provide excellent opportunities to
    study ecological speciation enforced by expansion of protein families via
    polyploidy. To test the key predictions of this hypothesis, we reported the
    de novo genome sequence of Adiantum nelumboides, a tetraploid homosporous
    fern. The obtained draft genome had a size of 6.27 Gb assembled into 11,767
    scaffolds with the contig N50 of 1.37 Mb. Repetitive DNA sequences
    contributed with about 81.7%, a remarkably high proportion of the genome.
    With 69,568, the number of predicted protein-coding genes exceeded those
    reported in most other land plant genomes. Intragenomic synteny analyses
    recovered 443 blocks with the average block size of 1.29 Mb and the average
    gene content of 16 genes. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of
    high ancestral chromosome number, lack of substantial genome downsizing, and
    dominance of genic diploidization. As expected in the calciphilous plants, a
    notable number of detected genes were involved in calcium uptake and
    transport. In summary, the genome sequence of a tetraploid homosporous fern
    not only provides access to a genomic resource of a derived fern, but also
    supports the hypothesis of maintenance of high chromosome numbers and
    duplicated DNA in young polyploid ferns.

    Pteridium (the bracken) is a genus of common and widely distributed ferns
    throughout the world. The variation patterns of morphology in the genus are
    highly complex and no consensus has been reached among taxonomists regarding
    the number of species as well as subdivision of the variable species. To
    address the question of how many species and subspecies of Pteridium occur
    in Asia, 75 populations were sampled in Bolivia, China, Japan, Malaysia,
    Mexico and Peru. Sequence data of three chloroplast DNA regions,
    rps4-trnSGGA, rpl16 and trnSGCU-trnGUCC and the genotype data of three
    microsatellite loci were collected. The newly generated sequence data
    combined with the sequences already available from GenBank for samples from
    all over the world were subjected to several phylogenetic analyses and
    species delimitation tests. The results support recognition of two diploid
    species, P. aquilinum in the Northern Hemisphere and Africa and P.
    esculentum in South America and Australia. Evidence was found to recognize
    one Asian tetraploid species, P. semihastatum. The Eurasian occurrences of
    P. aquilinum can be further subdivided into subsp. aquilinum occurring in
    Africa, Europe and Asia Minor; subsp. japonicum occurring from East Asia to
    eastern Europe; subsp. wightianum occurring from central China to Malesia
    (Malay Peninsula, New Caledonia, New Zealand) and northern Australia. The
    North American subsp. latiusculum was also found in India. Some local
    “species” recorded in Flora of China likely represent hybrids between subsp.
    japonicum and subsp. wightianum.

    The lycophyte genus Selaginella alone constitutes the family
    Selaginellaceae, the largest of the lycophyte families. The genus is
    estimated to contain 700–800 species distributed on all continents except
    Antarctica, with highest species diversity in tropical and subtropical
    regions. The monophyly of Selaginella in this broad sense has rarely been
    doubted, whereas its intrageneric classiﬁcation has been notoriously
    contentious. Previous molecular studies were based on very sparse sampling
    of Selaginella (up to 62 species) and often used DNA sequence data from one
    genome. In the present study, DNA sequences of one plastid (rbcL) and one
    nuclear (ITS) locus from 394 accessions representing approximately 200
    species of Selaginella worldwide were used to infer a phylogeny using
    maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony methods. The
    study identiﬁes strongly supported major clades and well resolves
    relationships among them. Major results include: (i) six deep-level clades
    are discovered representing the deep splits of Selaginella; and (ii) 20
    major clades representing 20 major evolutionary lineages are identiﬁed,
    which differ from one another in molecular, macro-morphological, ecological
    and spore features, and/or geographical distribution.

    In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in Selaginellaceae
    including treatments in regional floras and the description of new species,
    but a comprehensive review of the phylogeny and taxonomy of the New World
    taxa is still lacking. Here we assembled a dataset of one plastid and five
    nuclear markers of 610 accessions representing ca. 338 species to
    reconstruct a global phylogeny with a focus on the New World taxa (291
    accessions representing ca. 160 species). Our major results include: (1)
    Sinoselaginelloideae are resolved as sister to Pulviniella +
    (Lycopodioidoideae + Selaginelloideae), different from previous results,
    illustrating the difficulty in resolving the affinities of
    Sinoselaginelloideae, (2) Selaginella schaffneri, included in a large-scale
    phylogeny for the first time, is resolved as the third earliest-diverging
    lineage in the family and a new genus, Mexiselaginella, and a new subfamily,
    Mexiselaginelloideae, are proposed, (3) there are ~319 (excluding four
    introduced/naturalized) species in 10 genera and six subfamilies in the New
    World and the New World is lacking 10 out of the 20 major clades (genera
    and/or subfamilies) in Selaginellaceae, (4) ca. 98% of the species diversity
    in the New World is found in Selaginelloideae and Gymnogynoideae, 69% of the
    species diversity is found in Selaginella s.s. alone, and ca. 96% of the
    species diversity is found in three genera, Selaginella s.s., Bryodesma, and
    Gymnogynum, (5) Selaginella rzedowskii is confirmed to have dorsal
    rhizophores and transferred to Lepidoselaginella, and (6) a list of species,
    genera, and subfamilies in Selaginellaceae from the New World is compiled
    and provided and a key to genera and subfamilies in the New World is given.
